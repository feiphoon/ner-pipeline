The seed-borne pathogens affecting <i>Panax ginseng</i> cultivation have not been fully characterized. Seed-borne fungi can be identified based on the high-throughput sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons. A hierarchical clustering tree diagram analysis based on operational taxonomic units revealed a relationship between the seed-borne fungi and the region from which the seeds were collected. This study analyzed the fungal diversity on 30 ginseng seed samples from the main ginseng-producing areas of China. The 50 most abundant genera were identified including those responsible for ginseng diseases, <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Nectria</i>, <i>Coniothyrium</i>, <i>Verticillium</i>, <i>Phoma</i>, and <i>Rhizoctonia</i>. <i>Fusarium</i> species, which are the primary causes of root rot, were detected in all seed samples. The results of a phylogenetic analysis indicated that the seed-borne fungal species originating from the same region were closely related. Fungi on ginseng seeds from eight different regions were divided into eight clades, suggesting they were correlated with the local storage medium. A total of 518 <i>Fusarium</i> isolates were obtained and 10 species identified, all of which can be detrimental to ginseng production. Pathogenicity tests proved that seed-borne <i>Fusarium</i> species can infect ginseng seedlings and 2-year-old ginseng root, with potentially adverse effects on ginseng yield and quality."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, 130112, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of Chinese Ministry of Education for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, Jilin, 130118, China."}], "Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5958-4878"], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Yi Ming", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, 130112, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Jin Chao", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, 130112, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ying Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of Chinese Ministry of Education for Edible and Medicinal Fungi, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, Jilin, 130118, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, 130112, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya Yu", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31850823", "10.1094/PDIS-09-19-1817-RE"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
