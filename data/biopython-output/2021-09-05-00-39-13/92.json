Results showed that the ginseng adventitious roots growth and differentiation ability could be affected faced with different incubation temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30\u00b0C for 35\u00a0days). Besides, the research also demonstrated that low-temperature stimulation could promote the accumulation of ginsenosides and the content of total ginsenosides increased by 2.53 times at 10\u00b0C-7d (10\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days and then transferred to 25\u00b0C for 28\u00a0days) compared with that at 25\u00b0C. Moreover, the transcriptional levels of functional genes and PgWRKYs were analyzed by this study and the correlation analysis showed that GPS, SS, CYP716A47, CYP716A53v2, UGT74AE2, UGT94Q2, PgWRKY1, PgWRKY3, and PgWRKY8 were significantly correlated with total ginsenosides content. Furthermore, HPLC-ESI-MS<sup>n</sup> analyzed that Malonyl-Rb<sub>1</sub> only existed in 10\u00b0C-7d group. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The survey showed that after a certain time of stimulating P. ginseng adventitious roots at low temperature, the accumulation of ginsenosides could be enhanced as their expression of related genes were regulated. It provides a theoretical foundation for the mass production of ginsenosides by controlling the temperature conditions of P. ginseng adventitious roots."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shihui", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Wenxia", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0050-501X"], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "01", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "01", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31353579", "10.1111/jfbc.12794"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
