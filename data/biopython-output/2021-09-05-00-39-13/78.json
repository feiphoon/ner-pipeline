These effects have been mediated by neurogenesis, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties, inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction, receptor-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, amyloid beta aggregation, and microglial activation as well as neurotransmitters modulation. However, these compounds have limited clinical application of for the prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. This might be due to incomplete data on their clinical pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties, and limited economic investments. There is an increasing trend in use of herbal medicines instead of chemical drugs, so it is time to make more attention to the application of ginseng, the grandfather of medicinal plants, from basic sciences to patients' bed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rameshrad", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology Department , School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-7755-2204"], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "gintonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30513224", "10.1080/13543776.2019.1556258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
