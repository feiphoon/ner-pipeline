The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of enzymatic hydrolysis combined with HHP treatments on ginsenoside metabolites in red ginseng.", "The yield and changes in the levels of polyphenol and ginsenoside were measured in red ginseng treated with commercial enzymes such as Ultraflo L, Viscozyme, Cytolase PCL5, Rapidase and Econase E at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa), 50\u2009MPa, and 100\u2009MPa. \u03b2-Glucosidase activity of Cytolase was the highest at 4258.2 mg<sup>-1</sup> , whereas Viscozyme showed the lowest activity at 10.6 mg<sup>-1</sup> . Pressure of 100\u2009MPa did not affect the stability or the activity of the \u03b2-glucosidase. Treatment of red ginseng with Cytolase and Econase at 100\u2009MPa significantly increased the dry weight and polyphenol content of red ginseng, compared with treatments at 0.1 MPa and 50\u2009MPa (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The amounts of ginsenoside and ginsenoside metabolites derived from red ginseng processed using Cytolase were higher than those derived from red ginseng treated with the other enzymes. Treatment with Cytolase also significantly increased the skin and intestinal permeability of red ginseng-derived polyphenols.", "Cytolase could be useful as an enzymatic treatment to enhance the yield of bioactive compounds from ginseng under HHP. In addition, ginsenoside metabolites obtained by Cytolase hydrolysis combined with HHP are functional substances with increased intestinal and skin permeability. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology, Food Technology, Graduate School, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyo Won", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Affairs, Korea University Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Sung Hee", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hotel Tourism and Culinary Arts, Culinary Arts and Food Service Management Major, Yuhan University, Bucheon, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seog-Won", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Seoul Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyeon-Son", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "Hyung Joo", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BK21 Plus, College of Health Science, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Ki-Bae", "Initials": "KB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biocatalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrostatic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Choi JR, Hong SW, Kim Y, Jang SE, Kim NJ, Han MJ et al., Metabolic activities of ginseng and its constituents, ginsenoside rb1 and rg1, by human intestinal microflora.
