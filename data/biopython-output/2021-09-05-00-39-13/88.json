In this study, the non-polluted cultivation technology system of P. ginseng was established based on the research results of field investigation in the cultivated regions. The system includes suitable planting regions selecting, planting method, field management, pest control, harvesting & processing, and quality control. Aimed at the serious issues in the cultivation, research strategies have been provided to guarantee the sustainable development of the ginseng industry. The patterns of soil restoration after P. ginseng cultivation, establishment the platform of comprehensive disease & pest control, breeding new varieties for high stress tolerance and resistance, and a traceability system for P. ginseng cultivation. In all, these strategies was considered to largely developing of the ginseng industry in the green and sustainable way."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-Wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Medico Corporation, Beijing 100062, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nai-Wu", "Initials": "NW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsumura & Co., Tokyo 107-8521, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naoli", "ForeName": "Fujihara", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medicinal Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-Lin", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "08", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192434", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0130"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
