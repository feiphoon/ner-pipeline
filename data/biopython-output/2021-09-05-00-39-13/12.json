Seed longevity is closely associated with germination rate and viability, so we assumed that if a seed loses its viability, specific metabolic alterations regarding plant growth factors might occur. In this study, we divided ginseng seeds into normal and accelerated-aging groups. Both groups were treated with gibberellic acid, which is one of the most important plant-growth regulators. Afterward, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the samples, to identify the metabolic alterations between the two groups.", "Forty-four endogenous metabolites in normal and accelerated aging groups were putatively identified. To determine the differential significance of these metabolites, t-tests and fold-change analysis were conducted followed by principal component analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis to determine the metabolites that showed distinct responses between the groups. Among the differentially expressed metabolites (P value < 0.05 and FDR\u2009<\u20090.1), nine metabolites were selected as potential biomarker candidates for the prediction of seed longevity.", "Nine metabolites related to ginseng seed longevity were identified by comparing metabolomes. Our findings suggest that ginseng propagation can be facilitated by the regulation of these distinctive metabolic features of the seeds. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Min", "ForeName": "Jung Eun", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Ji Yeon", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7161-4737"], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Sung Won", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Jeong Hill", "Initials": "JH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2012M3A9C4048796", "Agency": "National Research Foundation of Korea", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018R1A5A2024425", "Agency": "National Research Foundation of Korea", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "PJ014201022019", "Agency": "Rural Development Administration", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gibberellins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BU0A7MWB6L", "NameOfSubstance": "gibberellic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Discriminant Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gibberellins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Calixto JB, Beirith A, Ferreira J, Santos AR, Filho VC and Yunes RA, Naturally occurring antinociceptive substances from plants.
