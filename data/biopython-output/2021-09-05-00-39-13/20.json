HPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed that 20 ginsenosides were identified in root lines, notoginsenoside Fa and notoginsenoside R<sub>2</sub> were not found in AR lines. In AR lines, the highest accumulation of total ginsenosides was obtained in five-year main AR (24.87\u00a0mg/g). Principal component analysis classified root lines into three groups. Five-year ginseng was mostly similar with five-year main AR, five-year rootlet AR, and four-year rootlet AR in ginsenosides composition of group 1. Besides, gene expressions were consistent with the production of total ginsenosides, and correlation analysis revealed that total ginsenosides biosynthesis was significantly positively correlated with the gene expression of dammarenediol synthase. Five-year rootlet AR showed the highest activity on ferric-reducing antioxidant power test among samples. It provides a scientific evidence for the further exploitation and large-scale production of P. ginseng. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provides valuable information for the commercial scale culture of ginseng adventitious roots. This report combines morphology, ginsenoside composition and content, gene expression, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power test to evaluate the quality of P. ginseng adventitious root, and combined with principal component analysis to screen out the high yield and stable ginseng adventitious roots. It would be profitable to use adventitious root culture of P. ginseng instead of field cultivation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Wenxia", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shihui", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0003-0050-501X"], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "01", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "03", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "04", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31368571", "10.1111/jfbc.12901"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
