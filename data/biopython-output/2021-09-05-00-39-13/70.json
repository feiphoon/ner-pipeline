This endocrine disorder significantly affects the menstrual cycle and fertility. The aim of this present study was to assess the efficacy of Panax ginseng, one of traditional Chinese medicine, in ameliorating the gonadal hormonal dysfunction and lowering oxidative stress accompanied with hypothyroidism in adult female albino rats. After confirming regularity of the oestrus cycle in the female rats in this study, hypothyroidism was induced by using daily 5.0 mg kg-1 oral dose of Neo-mercazole. The hypothyroid rats were randomly grouped into two groups; hypothyroid group (H): did not received any treatment, group II (H+G) was treated with Panax ginseng extract for one months after hypothyroidism induction. Another two groups were included in the study, a negative control group (Euthyroid group) and a positive control group; received Panax ginseng extract only. Hypothyroidism resulted in irregularity of oestrus cycle accompanied with decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2), while prolactin (PRL), progesterone (P) and testosterone (T) hormone were significantly elevated. Hypothyroidism elevated capsae-3 and 8OH-deoxy guanosine expression and increased secretion of corticosterone and ERK1/2. This study showed that Panax ginseng improved hypothyroid-induced deterioration in trophic and gonadal hormones through free radicals' scavenger."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elgoly", "ForeName": "Amany H Mahmoud", "Initials": "AHM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahman", "ForeName": "Lobna F", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Taibah university, KSA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Magda Hm", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thyroid Hormones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W980KJ009P", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Corticosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Estrous Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Hormones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "04", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "06"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30403603"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
