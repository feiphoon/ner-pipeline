The ITS,18S and matK sequences of Panax genus were analyzed to develop species-specific SNP marker. Three pairs of species-specific primers were designed to establish a multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) and the samples from different region were tested. The results showed that when the annealing temperature was 60 \u2103 and the cycle number was 35, approximately 250, 500,1 000 bp specific band were obtained from P. ginseng, P. notoginseng and P. quinquefolius obtain, respectively. This method could also be used to authentificate admixture samples and could detect 0.5% percent of P. notoginseng or P. quinquefolius adulterated in P. ginseng, or 0.5% percent of P. ginseng or P. quinquefolius adulterated in P. notoginseng. The detect limit of P. ginseng in P. quinquefolius was 0.5% and P. notoginseng in P. quinquefolius was 1%. This results showed that the present method could be used as a promise method to identify Panax ginseng, P. notoginseng, P. quinquefolius and their admixture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yu-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yu-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "08"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29052393", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170222.001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
