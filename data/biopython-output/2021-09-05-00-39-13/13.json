Panax ginseng (ginseng) is well known as the key herb for replenishing Qi and tonifying Spleen. However, the pathogenesis of Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome and therapeutic mechanism of ginseng on Spleen-Qi deficiency constitution have not yet been entirely elucidated.", "The aim of this work was to investigate the pathogenesis of Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome and therapeutic mechanism of ginseng on Spleen-Qi deficiency constitution.", "The urinary metabonomics was investigated before and after ginseng treatment in Spleen-Qi deficiency subjects by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-QTOF-MS). The spectra of metabolites were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the score showed significant difference among the three different groups. The serum biochemical parameters creatine kinases (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined by assay kits. In addition, ultraweak photon emission (UPE) intensity was measured at dazhui point in each subject.", "According to the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) results and biochemistry databases searching, 15 potential biomarkers were identified to be involved in Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome and ginseng influenced Spleen-Qi deficiency. The metabonomics and biological experiment data indicated that metabolism pathways were corresponding to energy metabolism, amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid and pyrimidine metabolisms, oxidative stress urea cycle, and intestinal flora metabolism. And the UPE intensity decreased significantly after the treatment.", "Ginseng could promote the related metabolisms in Spleen-Qi deficiency constitution and the metabolites and UPE intensity may be useful as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring for Spleen-Qi deficiency syndrome."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
