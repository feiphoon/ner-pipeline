Thus, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis of nine major ginsenosides, including ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rf, Rg2, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, Rd, and Ro, in the roots of five-year-old <i>P. ginseng</i> cultivated in Bongwha, Korea in 2017 was performed. The total ginsenoside content changed as many as three times throughout the year, ranging from 1.37 \u00b1 0.02 (dry wt %) in January to 4.26 \u00b1 0.03% in May. Total ginsenoside content in the harvest season was 2.49 \u00b1 0.03%. Seasonal variations of panaxadiol-type ginsenosides (PPD) and panaxatriol-type ginsenosides (PPT) were found to be similar, but more PPD was always measured. However, the seasonal variation of oleanolic acid-type ginsenoside, Ro, was different from that of PPD and PPT, and the highest Ro content was observed in May. The ratio of PPD/PPT, as well as other representative ginsenosides, was compared throughout the year. Moreover, the percent composition of certain ginsenosides in both PPD and PPT types was found to be in a complementary relationship each other, which possibly reflected the biosynthetic pathway of the related ginsenosides. This finding would not only provide scientific support for the production and quality control of the value-added ginseng products, but also facilitate the elucidation of the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metalloenzyme Research Group and Department of Plant Biotechnology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong 17546, Korea. casualpe@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dongmin", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metalloenzyme Research Group and Department of Plant Biotechnology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong 17546, Korea. mihcoterie@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Mihyang", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metalloenzyme Research Group and Department of Plant Biotechnology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong 17546, Korea. gemstephenrana@gmail.com."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ra\u00f1a", "ForeName": "Gem Stephen", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metalloenzyme Research Group and Department of Plant Biotechnology, Chung-Ang University, Anseong 17546, Korea. jaehongh@cau.ac.kr."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0002-5328-3927"], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jaehong", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Molecules", "NlmUniqueID": "100964009", "ISSNLinking": "1420-3049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Ginseng Res. 2017 Jul;41(3):347-352", "ArticleIdList": ["28701876"]}, {"Citation": "Life Sci. 1995;56(19):1577-86", "ArticleIdList": ["7723586"]}, {"Citation": "J Chromatogr A. 2017 Feb 3;1483:20-29", "ArticleIdList": ["28027838"]}, {"Citation": "Nat Prod Rep. 2011 Mar;28(3):467-95", "ArticleIdList": ["21258738"]}, {"Citation": "J Ginseng Res. 2018 Jul;42(3):264-269", "ArticleIdList": ["29983607"]}, {"Citation": "Circulation. 2004 Sep 7;110(10):1219-25", "ArticleIdList": ["15337705"]}, {"Citation": "BMC Genomics. 2013 Aug 19;14:564", "ArticleIdList": ["23957709"]}, {"Citation": "Molecules. 2017 May 04;22(5):null", "ArticleIdList": ["28471389"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 2016 Jan 19;55(2):322-34", "ArticleIdList": ["26645466"]}, {"Citation": "Molecules. 2014 Oct 28;19(11):17381-99", "ArticleIdList": ["25353387"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 1999 Aug;66(2):123-9", "ArticleIdList": ["10433468"]}, {"Citation": "J Ginseng Res. 2014 Jan;38(1):66-72", "ArticleIdList": ["24558313"]}, {"Citation": "J Ginseng Res. 2015 Oct;39(4):338-44", "ArticleIdList": ["26869826"]}, {"Citation": "Nat Prod Res. 2013;27(9):851-4", "ArticleIdList": ["22871218"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "06", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "07", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "07", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30041413", "molecules23071824", "10.3390/molecules23071824", "PMC6099543"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
