We investigated the occurrence and incidence of plant viruses in <i>Panax ginseng</i> in Korea. A total of 656 leaf samples were combined into one and total RNA was extracted from the polled sample, using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), a metatranscriptome analysis of the plant virome was conducted. The virus present in <i>Panax ginseng</i> was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using virus-specific primers. In RNA-Seq data analysis, the multiplication protein of four viral contigs including <i>Aristotelia chilensis virus 1</i> (AcV1), <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV), <i>Watermelon mosaic virus</i> (WMV), and Tobamovirus multiplication protein were discovered. From our metatranscriptome analysis and RT-PCR assay, TuMV and WMV were detected, whereas the three viruses reported in China such as tomato yellow leaf curl China virus; panax notoginseng virus A; and panax virus Y were not found in this study. The distribution of domestic ginseng viruses seems different from that recorded in China. Overall, this is the first plant virome analysis of <i>Panax ginseng</i> in Korea."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Korean Society of Plant Pathology."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hong-Kyu", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "So-Yeon", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hee-Ji", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Da-Som", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Boram", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R&D Headquarters, Korea Ginseng Corporation, Daejeon 3418, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dong-Yun", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Jonghee", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Applied Biosciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 4566, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Su-Heon", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Plant Pathol J", "NlmUniqueID": "100966769", "ISSNLinking": "1598-2254"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflicts of Interest No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Dis. 2014 Sep;98(9):1284", "ArticleIdList": ["30699620"]}, {"Citation": "J Virol Methods. 2002 Oct;106(1):1-10", "ArticleIdList": ["12367724"]}, {"Citation": "Viruses. 2015 Apr 03;7(4):1685-99", "ArticleIdList": ["25855242"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Virol. 2010 Jun;155(6):949-57", "ArticleIdList": ["20446003"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Virol. 2016 Mar;161(3):731-4", "ArticleIdList": ["26660166"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "07", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33312100", "10.5423/PPJ.NT.07.2020.0137", "PPJ-36-643", "PMC7721534"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
