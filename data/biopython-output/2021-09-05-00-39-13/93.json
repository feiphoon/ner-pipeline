In recent years, gold nanoparticles have gained much attention due to their extensive range of applications in particular in the field of drug delivery as a result of their biological compatibility and low toxicity. In a previous study, we designed and developed biocompatible gold and silver nanoparticles based on phytochemical profile and pharmacological efficacy of P. ginseng berry extract, we were able to reduce gold ions to nanoparticles through the process of green synthesis. However, its potential as a cosmetic ingredient is still unexplored. The aim of the present study is to investigate the moisture retention, in-vitro scavenging and whitening properties of gold nanoparticles synthesized from P. ginseng berry in cosmetic applications. Our findings confirm that P. ginseng berry mediated gold nanoparticles exhibited moisture retention capacity. In addition, MTT assay results confirmed that P. ginseng berry mediated gold nanoparticles are non-toxic to human dermal fibroblast and murine melanoma skin cells, possess scavenging activity, protect and provide alleviation against injured caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage. In addition, P. ginseng berry mediated gold nanoparticles, significantly reduced melanin content and suppress tyrosinase activity in \u03b1-MSH-stimulated B16BL6 cells. We conclude that P. ginseng berry mediated gold nanoparticles are biocompatible and environmental affable materials and can be a potential novel cosmetic ingredient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Biotechnology and Ginseng Bank, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jim\u00e9nez", "ForeName": "Zuly", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Oriental Medicinal Biotechnology , Ginseng Bank College of Life Science, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yeon-Ju", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Biotechnology and Ginseng Bank, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathiyalagan", "ForeName": "Ramya", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Oriental Medicinal Biotechnology , Ginseng Bank College of Life Science, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Kwang-Hoon", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Biotechnology and Ginseng Bank, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohanan", "ForeName": "Padmanaban", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Biotechnology and Ginseng Bank, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Jong-Chan", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Oriental Medicinal Biotechnology , Ginseng Bank College of Life Science, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yu-Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Graduate School of Biotechnology and Ginseng Bank, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Oriental Medicinal Biotechnology , Ginseng Bank College of Life Science, Kyung Hee University , Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do , Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Deok Chun", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Melanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Skin Lightening Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Melanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Lightening Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28393568", "10.1080/21691401.2017.1307216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
