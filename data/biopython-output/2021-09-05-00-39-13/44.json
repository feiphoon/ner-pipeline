To analyze the expression of ERF family genes, the heat map clustering method was used by analyzing the ginseng transcriptomes of different parts and different growth years. The contents of ginsenosides Rg_1, Re and Rb_1 in various concentrations of MeJA-treated ginseng adventitious roots were determined by UPLC-MS/MS method. The expression of key genes of ginsenoside biosynthesis(DDS, CYP716A47, CYP716A53v2) and ERF family genes in MeJA-treated ginseng adventitious roots were determined by using real-time quantitative PCR. Pearson correlation was adopted to analyze the gene expression pattern of DDS, CYP716A47, CYP716A53v2 gene and ERF family. The results showed that the content of ginseng diol ginsenoside Rb_1 in ginseng adventitious roots treated with different concentrations of MeJA increased, and the content of ginseng triol ginsenoside Rg_1 and Re decreased. It is consistent with the increase of DDS and CYP716A47 expression and the decrease of CYP716A53v2 gene expression. The expression of ERF003, ERF118 and ERF012 genes was significantly positively correlated with CYP716A53v2, but negatively correlated with DDS. While the expression of ERF1B was significantly negatively correlated with CYP716A47.It is proved that ERF003, ERF118 and ERF012 were likely to inhibit the expression of DDS and promote the expression of CYP716A53v2, and ERF1B was likely to inhibit CYP716A47. This work could provide theoretical basis of ERF functional verification of regulating the biosynthesis of ginsenosides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu University Zhenjiang 212013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nan", "ForeName": "Tie-Gui", "Initials": "TG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Li-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu University Zhenjiang 212013, China National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32627483", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200329.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
