They are morphologically similar but have different pharmacological effects. Therefore, botanical origin authentication of these two ginsengs is of great importance for ensuring pharmaceutical efficacy and food safety. Based on the fact that intron position in orthologous genes is highly conserved across plant species, intron length polymorphisms were exploited from unigenes of ginseng. Specific primers were respectively designed for these two species based on their insertion/deletion sequences of cytochrome P450 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and multiplex PCR was conducted for molecular authentication of P.ginseng and P. quinquefolius. The results showed that the developed multiplex PCR assay was effective for molecular authentication of P.ginseng and P. quinquefolius without strict PCR condition and the optimization of reaction system.This study provides a preferred ideal marker system for molecular authentication of ginseng,and the presented method can be employed in origin authentication of other herbal preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rong-Bo", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Hui-Li", "Initials": "HL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gui-Sheng", "Initials": "GS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "INDEL Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29728034", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180201.004"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
