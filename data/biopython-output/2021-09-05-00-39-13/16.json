Over the last decade, significant agronomical progress has been made in the development of elite ginseng cultivars, increasing their production and quality. However, as one of the significant environmental factors, heat stress remains a challenge and poses a significant threat to ginseng plants' growth and sustainable production. This study was conducted to investigate the phenotype of ginseng leaves under heat stress using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) HSI system were used to acquire hyperspectral images for normal and heat stress-exposed plants, showing their susceptibility (Chunpoong) and resistibility (Sunmyoung and Sunil). The acquired hyperspectral images were analyzed using the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) technique, combining the variable importance in projection and successive projection algorithm methods. The correlation of each group was verified using linear discriminant analysis. The developed models showed 12 bands over 79.2% accuracy in Vis/NIR and 18 bands with over 98.9% accuracy at SWIR in validation data. The constructed beta-coefficient allowed the observation of the key wavebands and peaks linked to the chlorophyll, nitrogen, fatty acid, sugar and protein content regions, which differentiated normal and stressed plants. This result shows that the HSI with the PLS-DA technique significantly differentiated between the heat-stressed susceptibility and resistibility of ginseng plants with high accuracy."]}, "AuthorList":
