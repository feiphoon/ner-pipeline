A new analytical method for the simultaneous determination of multiple PGRs in 19 types of fresh Panax ginseng is developed by a new designed wool cluster-inspired ionic liquid-functionalized ordered mesoporous silica-integrated dispersive solid-phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography (IL-WFOMS-I-DSPE-HPLC). The proposed method combines the advantages of the multiple adsorption mechanisms, high mass transfer rate and large adsorption capacity of the synthesized IL-WFOMS adsorbent with the safe, convenient operation of the new designed I-DSPE method. Under optimized conditions, the recoveries at three spike levels were in a range of 77.6-98.3% for 3-indole acetic acid (IAA), 3-indole propionic acid (IPA), 3-indole butyric acid (IBA), and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) with the relative standard deviations (RSD) \u22648.6%, n\u202f=\u202f3. This method exhibits the advantages of safety, convenience, reliability, and has great potential for simultaneous determination of multiple trace PGRs in complex sample matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
