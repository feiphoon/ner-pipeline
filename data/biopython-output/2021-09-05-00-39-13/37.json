Different properties of P.\u00a0ginseng and P.\u00a0quinquefolius were confirmed not only in clinical findings, but also at cellular and molecular levels. The major pharmacological ingredients of P.\u00a0ginseng and P.\u00a0quinquefolius are the triterpene saponins known as ginsenosides. The P.\u00a0ginseng roots contain a higher ratio of ginsenoside Rg1:Rb1 than that in P.\u00a0quinquefolius. In ginseng plants, various ginsenosides are synthesized via three key reactions: cyclization, hydroxylation and glycosylation. To date, several genes including dammarenediol synthase (DS), protopanaxadiol synthase and protopanaxatriol synthase have been isolated in P.\u00a0ginseng and P.\u00a0quinquefolius. Although some glycosyltransferase genes have been isolated and identified association with ginsenoside synthesis in P.\u00a0ginseng, little is known about the glycosylation mechanism in P.\u00a0quinquefolius. In this paper, we cloned and identified a UDP-glycosyltransferase gene named Pq3-O-UGT2 from P.\u00a0quinquefolius (GenBank accession No. KR106207). In\u00a0vitro enzymatic activity experiments biochemically confirmed that Pq3-O-UGT2 catalyzed the glycosylation of Rh2 and F2 to produce Rg3 and Rd, and the chemical structure of the products were confirmed susing high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS). High sequence similarity between Pq3-O-UGT2 and PgUGT94Q2 indicated a close evolutionary relationship between P.\u00a0ginseng and P.\u00a0quinquefolius. Moreover, we established both P.\u00a0ginseng and P.\u00a0quinquefolius RNAi transgenic roots lines. RNA interference of Pq3-O-UGT2 and PgUGT94Q2 led to reduce levels of ginsenoside Rd, protopanaxadiol-type and total ginsenosides. Expression of key genes including protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol synthases was up-regulated in RNAi lines, while expression of dammarenediol synthase gene was not obviously increased. These results revealed that P.\u00a0quinquefolius was more sensitive to the RNAi of Pq3-O-UGT2 and PgUGT94Q2 when compared with P.\u00a0ginseng."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
