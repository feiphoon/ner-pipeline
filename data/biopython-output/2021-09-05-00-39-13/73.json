Since the mechanism of this disorder is unknown, there are no effective prevention measures for RSD. The proteomic changes in RSD ginseng were analysed in this study by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). The differential expression of 137 proteins (60 from 2-DE and 77 from iTRAQ) was identified in RSD ginseng as compared with healthy ginseng. Most changes are related to carbon- and nitrogen- metabolism, redox homeostasis, and stress resistance. We also found that the concentration of metal elements, such as iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), and manganese (Mn), was significantly increased in RSD ginseng. These increased metals would be chelated with phenols to form red spots on the ginseng epidermis. Moreover, RSD disturbed the carbon and nitrogen metabolism and affected the biosynthesis of nutrients (sugar, proteins, amino acids) and active components (ginsenosides), which reduced the survival rate and medicinal value of ginseng. These differences between RSD and healthy ginseng will contribute to the understanding of RSD mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Technology Innovation Center for Chinese Medicine Biotechnology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Technology Innovation Center for Chinese Medicine Biotechnology, Beihua University, Jilin, 132013, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xuenan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130021, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Daqing", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21205, USA; and Corresponding authors.
