However,there are relatively few cultivation ginseng varieties for farmland in China. Correlative analysis of qualitity and agronomic traits of P. ginseng cultivation in the farmland could provide a reference for the selection of excellent germplasm and new variety breeding of P. ginseng. In this study,the main index of saponin and agronomic traits of 4-6 years&apos; samples were analyzed by UPLC and measured. The results show that there was significant difference in agronomic indexes of Damaya. The coefficient of variation of the root length( CV = 41. 97%) and fresh weight( CV = 31. 81%) were maximum,and the coefficient of variation of the stems thickness( 16. 72%) and root thickness were minimum. There was a significant correlation between yield and root thickness( P&lt;0. 05). There was significant difference in drug yield of different harvest years( P&lt;0. 05),and the yield of 6-years was 31. 52%-39. 69% higher than 4-years. However,there wasn&apos;t significant difference in total ginsenosides between 4 and 6 years old P. ginseng,but there was significant difference in ginseng Rg2,Rc and Rb2( P&lt;0. 05),and the ginsenoside contents of different harvesting years were accorded with the criterion standards of 2015 Chinese Pharmacopoeia. There was no significant correlation between the saponin and the agronomic trait,while there was positive correlation with root thickness( P &lt; 0. 05). Therefore,the stem diameter was positive correlation with yield of P. ginseng. Selection of the stem thickness of seedlings is beneficial to the increase of the yield and breeding of P. ginseng."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Hao-Yu", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy,Hubei University of Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Medico Corporation Tianjin 300301,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Ke", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xi-Wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Guang-Wei", "Initials": "GW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Lin-Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Medico Corporation Tianjin 300301,China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Nai-Wu", "Initials": "NW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsumura & Co.
