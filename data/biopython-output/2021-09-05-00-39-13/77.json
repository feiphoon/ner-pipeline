The active ingredient profiles in P. ginseng single decoction and co-decoction of GA were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The experimental pharmacology method was used to explore the effect of GA co-decoction on the hematopoietic function of chemotherapy mice.", "The active ingredient profiles of the co-decoction of GA significantly changed compared with those of the single decoction. Compared with GA1:0 (single decoction of Panax ginseng), the routine ginsenosides of all proportions of GA decreased significantly, but the proportion of rare ginsenosides increased significantly. The changes of contents of rare ginsenosides of GA were basically consistent with the trends of effects on the myelosuppression induced by CY. Compared with the model group, GA significantly increased the number of bone marrow nucleated cells, thymus index, peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets, and significantly reduced the spleen index. Moreover, GA could promote G1 phase bone marrow cells to enter the cell cycle, increase the proportion of S phase cells and G2/M phase cells, and increase the cell proliferation index.", "GA can ameliorate the hematopoietic function of mice after chemotherapy, and GA2:3, GA3:2 were the best, which may be due to the changes of the pharmacodynamic material basis of GA after compatibility. All these results implied that GA may be an ideal drug and food supplement for the treatment of toxic and side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
