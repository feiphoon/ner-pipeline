Physico-chemical separation was first applied to recover the released polysaccharides and ginsenoside. Enzymatic hydrolysis was then conducted to covert the left PGR into mono-sugars which was following transformed into succinic acid by constructing a succinic acid-producing strain of Escherichia coli-ZW333. Results indicated that the yields of polysaccharides and ginsenosides increased according to the increase of deconstruction content of PGR. A total sugar yield reached 52\u00a0g/L at 10% PGR loading and increased to 94.33\u00a0g/L following fed-batch enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, 56.28\u00a0g/L succinic acid was produced. In total, 18\u00a0g ginseng polysaccharides, 230\u00a0mg ginsenosides and 39\u00a0g succinic acid were produced from 100\u00a0g PGR. Accordingly, the total economic output could reach RMB 80,149 from 1\u00a0t PGR, illustrating the great value increasement of PGR by this industrially possible process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
