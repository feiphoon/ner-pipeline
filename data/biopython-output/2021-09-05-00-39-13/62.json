A. Meyer, has been used as traditional medicine in Asian for >2000\u202fyears. It is famous for its healthcare and therapeutic effects. Phytochemistry studies revealed that the major components of P. ginseng are: ginsenosides, polysaccharides, small peptides and essential oil. Modern research has proved that polysaccharide is one of the most important active ingredients in P. ginseng, which also takes up the largest slice of the chemical components. However, the past research was heavily oriented towards the small molecular ginsenosides. Thus, the main purpose of the present review is to summarize the preparation process, structure and biological functions of P. ginseng polysaccharides for further science research and application in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
