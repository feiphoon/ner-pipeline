Combination of two commonly consumed ginseng species, American ginseng (AG) and a Korean Red ginseng (KRG), enriched with ginsensoide Rg3, was shown to concomitantly improve glucemic control and blood pressure. We evaluated the hypothesis that improvements in central hemodynamics, vascular function and stiffness markers are involved in observed benefits of co-administration.", "In this randomized, placebo controlled, two-center trial, patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension were assigned to either 2.25\u202fg ginsenoside Rg3-enriched KRG&AG co-administration or a control 3 times daily for 12-weeks, treated by standard of care. The effects on central hemodynamics, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and endothelial function over the 12-week administration were analyzed.", "In intent-to-treat analysis of 80 individuals, a reduction in central systolic BP (-4.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.24\u202fmmHg, p\u202f=\u202f0.04) was observed with co-administration of Rg3-KRG\u202f+\u202fAG relative to control at 12-weeks, which was characterized by a decrease in end-systolic pressure (-6.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5\u202fmmHg, p\u202f=\u202f0.01) and area under the systolic/diastolic BP curve (-132.80\u202f\u00b1\u202f65.1, p\u202f=\u202f0.04, 220.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f91.1, p\u202f=\u202f0.02, respectively).
