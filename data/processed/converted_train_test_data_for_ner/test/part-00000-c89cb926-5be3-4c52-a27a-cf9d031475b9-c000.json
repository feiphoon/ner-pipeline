{"data":"Efficacy and Safety of Centella Asiatica (L.) Urb. on Wrinkles: A Systematic Review of Published Data and Network Meta-Analysis. Centella asiatica has many applications in cosmetics, including wrinkle treatments, but its effectiveness remains to be clarified. This systematic review study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of C. asiatica for reducing facial wrinkles. PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thai Library Integrated System, and Thai university database/journals were searched until May 2019. Five double-blinded randomised controlled trials, including 172 Asian females, were included. Endpoints were wrinkling measured by visual score, image analysis, and participant satisfaction. Two placebo-controlled studies applied gel/creams containing C. asiatica or asiaticoside for 12 w to periorbital skin. Two studies applied tretinoin or Pueraria mirifica contralaterally and by network meta-analysis C. asiatica appeared more effective than P. mirifica but possibly less than tretinoin. Asiaticoside applied as a lipstick for 8 w reduced lip wrinkling. Skin hydration was markedly raised by C. asiatica but not tretinoin. One study reported 10 adverse events for C. asiatica and 35 for tretinoin. Cochrane risk of bias was generally low, reporting was weak, and lack of C. asiatica standardization prevents general application. From the reported data, it is possible to conclude that C. asiatica improved lip and periocular wrinkles, and may replace retinoids if its long-term safety is established and C. asiatica is standardized.","id":23,"label":[["23","50","scientific"],["129","146","common"]],"pmid":"33413787"}

{"data":"Inhibition of Inflammatory Responses by Centella asiatica via Suppression of IRAK1-TAK1 in Mouse Macrophages. Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. (C. asiatica) has been widely treated for inflammation-related diseases in China for thousands of years. While C. asiatica showed relevant effects as traditional medicine, the mechanism of C. asiatica suppressing inflammation has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of methanol fraction from C. asiatica (MCA) at the molecular level in murine macrophages. Levels of inflammation-related mediators were observed with treatment of MCA. MCA significantly suppressed nitric oxide production and iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Prostaglandin E2 production was alleviated by MCA via the downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2. MCA treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text] and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. LPS/D-GalN-induced acute hepatitis in mouse was alleviated by MCA treatment. In addition, MCA decreased the phosphorylation of inhibitory [Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] (I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text]) at Ser32/36 and thereby blocked I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] degradation. TXY motif phosphorylation in the activation loops of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was also suppressed by MCA treatment. Further investigation revealed that MCA inhibited transforming growth factor-[Formula: see text]-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) phosphorylation and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) degradation, the upstream kinases activating nuclear factor [Formula: see text]B and MAPKs. Taken together, MCA exhibited anti-inflammatory properties via the downregulation of IRAK1-TAK1 signaling pathways.","id":25,"label":[["110","137","scientific"],["40","57","common"]],"pmid":"32668965"}
{"data":"Optimization of Light Intensity, Temperature, and Nutrients to Enhance the Bioactive Content of Hyperforin and Rutin in St. John's Wort. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a medicinal plant that alleviates depression and other disorders due to its abundance of active ingredients. Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 °C) and light intensity (49-147 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect. The accumulation of melatonin might not be influenced by cultivation conditions. Light intensity and temperature are easily controlled environmental factors in artificial cultivation, both of which are related to secondary metabolite production in the plant. Based on RSM, the optimal conditions for the accumulation of hyperforin and rutin were obtained. The maximum content of hyperforin was 5.6 mg/g, obtained at a temperature of 19 °C, a nutrient solution concentration of 45%, and a light intensity of 49 μmol m-2 s-1 PPFD. The maximum content of rutin was 3.8 mg/g obtained at a temperature of 18 °C, a nutrient solution concentration of 50%, and a light intensity of 147 μmol m-2 s-1 PPFD. This evaluation of suitable conditions for the accumulation of bioactive compounds in St. John's wort can be applied to plant factories on a large scale.","id":26,"label":[["154","177","scientific"],["137","152","common"],["120","135","common"],["375","390","common"],["611","625","common"],["1904","1919","common"]],"pmid":"32948004"}
{"data":"Protective effects of Centella asiatica leaf extract on dimethylnitrosamine‑induced liver injury in rats. Oxidative stress in liver injury is a major pathogenetic factor in the progression of liver damage. Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, known in the United States as Gotu kola, is widely used as a traditional herbal medicine in Chinese or Indian Pennywort. The efficacy of Centella asiatica is comprehensive and is used as an anti‑inflammatory agent, for memory improvement, for its antitumor activity and for treatment of gastric ulcers. The present study investigated the protective effects of Centella asiatica on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)‑induced liver injury in rats. The rats in the treatment groups were treated with Centella asiatica at either 100 or 200 mg/kg in distilled water (D.W) or with silymarin (200 mg/kg in D.W) by oral administration for 5 days daily following intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg DMN. Centella asiatica significantly decreased the relative liver weights in the DMN‑induced liver injury group, compared with the control. The assessment of liver histology showed that Centella asiatica significantly alleviated mass periportal ± bridging necrosis, intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis, with fibrosis of liver tissues. Additionally, Centella asiatica significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde, significantly increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and may have provided protection against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Centella asiatica significantly decreased inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑10, IL‑12, tumor necrosis factor‑α, interferon‑γ and granulocyte/macrophage colony‑stimulating factor. These results suggested that Centella asiatica had hepatoprotective effects through increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the levels of inflammatory mediators in rats with DMN‑induced liver injury. Therefore, Centella asiatica may be useful in preventing liver damage.","id":27,"label":[["206","234","scientific"],["22","39","common"],["266","275","common"],["339","355","common"],["373","390","common"],["596","613","common"],["724","741","common"],["925","942","common"],["1106","1123","common"],["1278","1295","common"],["1584","1601","common"],["1828","1845","common"],["2028","2045","common"]],"pmid":"27748812"}

{"data":"DNA Authentication of St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) Commercial Products Targeting the ITS Region. There is considerable potential for the use of DNA barcoding methods to authenticate raw medicinal plant materials, but their application to testing commercial products has been controversial. A simple PCR test targeting species-specific sequences within the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was adapted to screen commercial products for the presence of Hypericum perforatum L. material. DNA differing widely in amount and extent of fragmentation was detected in a number of product types. Two assays were designed to further analyse this DNA using a curated database of selected Hypericum ITS sequences: A qPCR assay based on a species-specific primer pair spanning the ITS1 and ITS2 regions, using synthetic DNA reference standards for DNA quantitation and a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay separately targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions. The ability of the assays to detect H. perforatum DNA sequences in processed medicines was investigated. Out of twenty different matrices tested, both assays detected H. perforatum DNA in five samples with more than 10³ ITS copies µL-1 DNA extract, whilst the qPCR assay was also able to detect lower levels of DNA in two further samples.

{"data":"The Biochemical and Genetic Basis for the Biosynthesis of Bioactive Compounds in Hypericum Perforatum L., One of the Largest Medicinal Crops in Europe. Hypericum perforatum L. commonly known as Saint John's Wort (SJW), is an important medicinal plant that has been used for more than 2000 years. Although H. perforatum produces several bioactive compounds, its importance is mainly linked to two molecules highly relevant for the pharmaceutical industry: the prenylated phloroglucinol hyperforin and the naphtodianthrone hypericin. The first functions as a natural antidepressant while the second is regarded as a powerful anticancer drug and as a useful compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While the antidepressant activity of SJW extracts motivate a multi-billion dollar industry around the world, the scientific interest centers around the biosynthetic pathways of hyperforin and hypericin and their medical applications.

However, uptake and retention in H. perforatum compartments of Co, Cr, and Ni, which markedly differentiated the investigated soils, were controlled by excluding mechanisms of the plant. Despite this, the Ni concentrations in the aerial parts, commonly used in herbal preparations, of H. perforatum plants from serpentine soils were not insignificant in relation to eventual human consumption. Good practice to assure the herbal product quality of H. perforatum collected from the wild cannot ignore the thorough understanding of the geolithological and geochemical features of the harvesting areas.","id":36,"label":[["60","82","scientific"],["756","779","scientific"],["781","796","common"]],"pmid":"30043286"}
{"data":"Improvements in estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia by Hypericum perforatum L. extract are associated with gut microbiota and related metabolites in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Hypericum perforatum L. (HP), a well-known natural medicine, has a potential effect on menopausal hypercholesterolemia. However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia. The underlying mechanism may be associated with improvements in gut microbiota composition and the profile of related metabolites as well as increases in bile acid secretion.","id":37,"label":[["68","91","scientific"],["189","212","scientific"]],"pmid":"33383372"}
