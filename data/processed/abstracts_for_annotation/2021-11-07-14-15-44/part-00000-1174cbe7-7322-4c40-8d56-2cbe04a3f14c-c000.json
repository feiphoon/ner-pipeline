{"pmid":"32302108","text":"Daisy Chain Dendrimers: Integrated Mechanically Interlocked Molecules with Stimuli-Induced Dimension Modulation Feature. The precise construction of the high-order mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) with well-defined topological arrangements of multiple mechanically interlocked units has been a great challenge. Herein, we present the first successful preparation of a new family of daisy chain dendrimers, in which the individual [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units serve as the branches of dendrimer skeleton. In particular, the third-generation daisy chain dendrimer with 21 [c2]daisy chain rotaxane moieties was realized, which might be among the most complicated discrete high-order MIMs comprised of multiple [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units. Interestingly, such unique topological arrangements of multiple stimuli-responsive [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes endowed the resultant daisy chain dendrimers controllable and reversible nanoscale dimension modulation through the collective and amplified extension/contraction of each [c2]daisy chain rotaxane branch upon the addition of acetate anions or DMSO molecules as external stimulus. Furthermore, on the basis of such an intriguing size switching feature of daisy chain dendrimers, dynamic composite polymer films were constructed through the incorporation of daisy chain dendrimers into polymer films, which could undergo fast, reversible, and controllable shape transformations when DMSO molecules were employed as stimulus. The successful merging of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes and dendrimers described herein provides not only a brand-new type of high-order mechanically interlocked systems with well-defined topological arrangements of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes, but also a successful and practical approach toward the construction of supramolecular dynamic materials."}
{"pmid":"30314325","text":"Insulin Mimetic Properties of Extracts Prepared from <i>Bellis perennis</i>. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and consequential cardiovascular diseases lead to millions of deaths worldwide each year; 90% of all people suffering from DM are classified as Type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. T2DM is linked to insulin resistance and a loss of insulin sensitivity. It leads to a reduced uptake of glucose mediated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle and adipose tissue, and finally hyperglycemia. Using a fluorescence microscopy-based screening assay we searched for herbal extracts that induce GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin, and confirmed their activity in chick embryos. We found that extracts prepared from <i>Bellis perennis</i> (common daisy) are efficient inducers of GLUT4 translocation in the applied in vitro cell system. In addition, these extracts also led to reduced blood glucose levels in chicken embryos (in ovo), confirming their activity in a living organism. Using high-performance liquid chromtaography (HPLC) analysis, we identified and quantified numerous polyphenolic compounds including apigenin glycosides, quercitrin and chlorogenic acid, which potentially contribute to the induction of GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, <i>Bellis perennis</i> extracts reduce blood glucose levels and are therefore suitable candidates for application in food supplements for the prevention and accompanying therapy of T2DM."}

A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane with two diarylacetylene cores was efficiently synthesized in 53 % yield by capping a C<sub>2</sub> -symmetric pseudo[2]rotaxane composed of two diarylacetylene-substituted permethylated α-cyclodextrins (PM α-CDs) with aniline stoppers. The maximum absorption wavelength of the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane remained almost unchanged in various solvents, unlike that of the stoppered monomer, indicating that the two independent diarylacetylene cores were insulated from the external environment by the PM α-CDs. Furthermore, the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane exhibited fluorescence emission derived from both diarylacetylene monomers and the excimer, which implies that the [c2]daisy chain structure can undergo contraction and extension. This is the first demonstration of a system in which excimer formation between two π-conjugated molecules within an isolated space can be controlled by the unique motion of a [c2]daisy chain rotaxane."}

Seven oleanane-type triterpene saponin bisdesmosides, perennisaponins N-T (1-7), were newly isolated from a methanol extract of daisy, the flowers of Bellis perennis L. (Asteraceae). The structures were determined based on chemical and physicochemical data and confirmed using previously isolated related compounds as references. The isolates, including 13 previously reported perennisaponins A-M (8-20), exhibited anti-proliferative activities against human digestive tract carcinoma HSC-2, HSC-4, and MKN-45 cells. Among them, perennisaponin O (2, IC50 = 11.2, 14.3, and 6.9 μM, respectively) showed relatively strong activities. The mechanism of action of 2 against HSC-2 was found to involve apoptotic cell death. "}
