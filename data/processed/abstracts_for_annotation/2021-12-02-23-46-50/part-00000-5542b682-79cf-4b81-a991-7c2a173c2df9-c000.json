This study aims to determine the effects of C. asiatica on cognitive function and its related properties. The current systematic review includes five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica alone and six RCTs conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica-containing products. Meta-analysis indicated that there are no significant differences in all cognitive function domains of C. asiatica when compared to placebo. However, it could improve mood by increasing alert scores [SMD: 0.71 (95% CI; 0.01 to 1.41); I2 = 30.5%] and decreasing anger scores at 1 hour after treatment [SMD: -0.81 (95%CI; -1.51 to -0.09); I2 = 36.6%]. None of the studies reported adverse effects of C. asiatica. In conclusion, there is not strong evidence to support the use of C. asiatica for cognitive function improvement in each cognitive domain. C. asiatica could improve alertness and relieve anger. However, some limitations should be aware including dose regimen, plant preparation, standardization, and product variation. Future well-designed clinical trials using suitable doses of standardized C. asiatica are still needed."}

However, improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However, silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus, plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy. Overall, our findings suggest Hyp-1 modulates recalcitrance to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum."}

However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia. The underlying mechanism may be associated with improvements in gut microbiota composition and the profile of related metabolites as well as increases in bile acid secretion."}

The study aimed at developing polymer hybrid nasal nanocomposite for enhanced delivery of Centella to the CNS. Thiolated chitosan was complexed with Centella to form a composite using EDAC hydrochloride. The composite was characterized by FTIR, XRD, NMR, and MS. Further, this composite was converted into a nanoformulation by the ionic-gelation method, characterized, and subjected to ex vivo permeation studies. Additionally, MTT assay was performed using Human Uumbilical cord Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) mimicking Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) to establish the safety of nanocomposite. The targeting efficacy was predicted by molecular docking studies against receptors associated with BBB. The FTIR, XRD, NMR, and MS studies confirmed the chemical conjugation of thiolated chitosan with Centella. Nanocomposite characterization through SEM, AFM, and DLS confirmed the size and stability of the developed nanocomposite having a zeta potential of - 14.5 mV and PDI of 0.260.

Alternative therapeutics are as well incorporated into the health guidelines of some countries. This research aimed to look into the underlying mechanisms of functional foods and how they may improve the long-term post COVID-19 cardiovascular, diabetic, and respiratory complications through their bioactive compounds. The potentiality of nine functional foods for post COVID-19 complications was investigated through computational approaches. A total of 266 bioactive compounds of these foods were searched via extensive literature reviewing. Three highly associated targets namely troponin I interacting kinase (TNNI3K), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) were selected for cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, respectively, after COVID-19 infections. Best docked compounds were further analyzed by network pharmacological tools to explore their interactions with complication-related genes (MAPK1 and HSP90AA1 for cardiovascular, PPARG and TNF-alpha for diabetes, and AKT-1 for respiratory disorders). Seventy-one suggested compounds out of one-hundred and thirty-nine (139) docked compounds in network pharmacology recommended 169 Gene Ontology (GO) items and 99 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways preferably AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ACE2 receptor signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway.

Analysis of variance has revealed significant differences among studied samples due to their origin from different countries, especially between Belarussian samples and others. Differences owing to belonging to various plant species were also found, as it was noticed in the case of Polygoni aviculare herba in comparison with other botanical plant species. Moreover, multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to gather herbal drugs based on similarity of chemical composition. CA grouped the samples into clusters with similar level of elements and total flavonoid contents, and PCA has indicated Hyperici herba, Tiliae flores, and Crataegi fructus as herbal remedies with close concentration of studied elements and flavonoids."}

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of herba centellae on protein and mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). A unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was established in 50 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Blood samples were collected and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, serum creatinine (Scr), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) detected the localization and expression levels of HGF and MCP-1. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detected the mRNA expression of HGF and MCP-1. Thirty rats were used to prepare the rat serum containing drug by cell culture, and qPCR and immunocytochemistry (ICC) were performed to examine the mRNA and protein expression of HGF and MCP-1. MCP-1 and its mRNA expression was significantly higher in rat renal interstitium of the UUO group and cells of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) stimulation group compared with that of the control group (P0.05). The levels of BUN decreased in the drug intervention group; however, no significant differences were determined in Scr, ALT and AST levels. Herba centellae may have inhibited MCP-1 and its mRNA expression through the upregulation of HGF and its mRNA expression, in order to achieve resistance to TIF without showing evident hepatorenal toxicity."}

Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) constitute a class of oligomeric and polymeric polyphenols with flavan-3-ols as monomeric building blocks. Despite the high impact of proanthocyanidins, these polyphenols are mostly quantified by colorimetric methods or by chromatographic determination of the flavan-3-ols as cleavage products or low molecular oligomers as lead compounds. For St. John's wort (Hyperici herba) from Hypericum perforatum, a protocol for preparative isolation of oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins from an acetone-water extract by chromatography on Sephadex®LH20 in combination with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography on the diol stationary phase was developed, yielding procyanidin reference clusters with a defined degree of polymerization from 3 to 10. Identity and purity of these clusters was proven by high-performance liquid chromatography (RP18 and diol phase) and mass spectrometry. For identification and quantification of proanthocyanidin clusters from St. John's wort, an ICH-Q2 (International harmonized guideline for analytical validation) validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorimetric detection was developed using an acetone-water extract of the herbal material, purified by solid-phase extraction for the removal of naphthodianthrones. The method enabled the quantification of procyanidin clusters with a degree of polymerization from 2 to 10. Analysis of nine batches of Hyperici herba from different sources indicated a high variability of proanthocyanidin content in the range from 8 to 37 mg/g. In all of the batches investigated, the trimer cluster DP3 was the dominant proanthocyanidin (about 40 %), followed by DP 4 (about 15 %) and DP5 (about 12 %). Monitoring of procyanidin distribution during seasonal growth of fresh plants of H. perforatum indicated the highest proanthocyanidin content in young plants (about 50 mg/g) and a time-dependent decrease during the growing season to about 16 mg/g. The highest proanthocyanidin content was found in young leaves and flowers, while the fruits were proanthocyanidin-free; older parts of the stem and the herb had a lower proanthocyanidin content. From these data, it can be concluded that proanthocyanidins serve as part of the plant defense system in the reproductive organs."}

The aims were to identify the possibility that C. asiatica ameliorates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the cerebrum in diabetes. C. asiatica leave aqueous extract (C. asiatica) (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/b.w.) were given to diabetic rats for 28 days. Changes in rats' body weight, food and water intakes, and insulin and FBG levels were monitored. Following sacrificed, cerebrum was harvested and subjected for histological, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. The results revealed treatment with C. asiatica was able to ameliorate the loss in body weight, the increase in food and water intakes, the decrease in insulin, and the increase in FBG levels in diabetic rats. Additionally, histopathological changes in the cerebrum and levels of p38, ERK, JNK, cytosolic Nrf2, Keap-1, LPO, RAGE, and AGE levels decreased; however, PI3K, AKT, IR, IRS, GLUT-1, nuclear Nrf2, Nqo-1, Ho-1, and anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) levels increased in diabetic rats receiving C. asiatica.

Common St. John's wort, Hypericum perforatum L. (Malpighiales: Hypericaceae), is a weed in Maine wild blueberry fields. A survey of its presence and relative density in 55 wild blueberry fields was conducted from 2013 to 2016. The objectives of this study were to determine how widespread it is as a weed in wild blueberry and whether it might indirectly contribute to beneficial ecosystem services for wild blueberry. It was found that St. John's wort occurs in about half (45.5%) of all wild blueberry fields surveyed. The crop cycle (prune vs cropping year) affected its relative abundance, significantly less St. John's wort was found in prune fields. St. John's wort relative abundance in wild blueberry fields was not affected by farming system (conventional vs organic) or landscape surrounding blueberry fields. Geographical distribution modeling was performed using the software Maxent. In Maine, the most likely areas predicted to be infested with St. John's wort were the two major blueberry production regions: Mid-coast and Downeast, Maine. Insects associated with St. John's wort were diverse. This weed appears to be under considerable herbivore pressure, especially hemipterans and Chrysolina spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) beetles that have been released for biological control. Insect predators and parasitoids were abundant and may not only reduce herbivory on St. John's wort but may also provide a valuable ecosystem service in terms of predator spillover, resulting in reduction of wild blueberry insect pests.

The relationship between the anti-inflammatory effect of Centella asiatica on hippocampal BDNF and the involvement of sirtuin-1, a BDNF expression regulator, in neuroprotective mechanisms of Centella asiatica warrants an investigation. We investigated the effect of Centella asiatica ethanolic extracts (CA) on TNF-α, IL-10, and SIRT1 levels and whether these predicted BDNF expression in rat hippocampus after chronic stress. For the experiments, thirty male rats (Sprague Dawley) were divided into six groups: nonstressed-control, stressed-control, nonstressed +CA 300mg/kg/d, stressed +CA 150 mg/kg/d, stressed +CA 300 mg/kg/d, and stressed +CA 600 mg/kg/d. On day 28, rats were sacrificed and hippocampus was dissected out. Hippocampal TNF-α, IL-10, SIRT1, and BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hippocampal TNF-α level was significantly higher in the stressed-control compared to nonstressed-control groups. Across all stress conditions, rats receiving the highest dose of CA had the lowest mean TNF-α and highest mean BDNF. There were no significant differences in IL-10 and SIRT1 levels between groups. Hippocampal TNF-α did not predict hippocampal BDNF in a regression analysis. In conclusion, lower TNF-α and higher BDNF in the hippocampus support the hypothesis that these factors independently contribute to Centella asiatica's neuroprotective effect in chronically stressed rats."}

Centella asiatica (Indian pennywort) has wide application in Indian and Chinese traditional medicines with documented evidence for wound healing and neuroprotective and anti-aging potential. Asiaticoside, a trisaccharide triterpene, is the most medicinally active compound in the plant. β-Amyrin synthase and squalene synthase have been identified as the two key genes in the triterpenoid pathway which regulate the production of asiaticoside in C. asiatica. The paper reports salient findings of our study utilizing the growth-promoting endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica to successfully colonize roots of C. asiatica in vitro cultures for investigating the effect of the mutualistic association on asiaticoside production. Co-cultivation of P. indica resulted in the rapid enhancement of root and shoot biomass of host plant, which was visible after 7 days of culture and continued up to 45 days. P. indica co-cultivation also favored the synthesis of asiaticosides, as evidenced by HPLC analysis which indicated about twofold increase (0.53% (w/w) in leaves and 0.23% (w/w) in whole plant) over control (0.33% (w/w) in leaves and 0.14% (w/w) in whole plant).

The study analyzed 276 samples of common vegetables eaten raw in Malaysia (Wild cosmos = 8; Japanese parsley = 21; Cabbage = 30; Lettuce = 16; Indian pennywort = 17; Carrot = 31; Sweet potato = 29; Tomato = 38; Cucumber = 28; Four winged bean = 26; Long bean = 32). The samples were purchased from two supermarkets (A and B) and two wet markets (C and D). The occurrence of V. parahaemolyticus detected was 20.65%, with higher frequency of V. parahaemolyticus in vegetables obtained from wet markets (Wet market C = 27.27%Wet Market D = 32.05%) compared to supermarkets (Supermarket A = 1.64%; Supermarket B = 16.67%). V. parahaemolyticus was most prevalent in Indian pennywort (41.18%). The density of V. parahaemolyticus in all the samples ranged from 2400 MPN/g, mostly <3 MPN/g concentration. Raw vegetables from wet markets contained higher levels of V. parahaemolyticus compared to supermarkets. V. parahaemolyticus were present in raw vegetables although in low numbers. The results suggest that raw vegetables act as a transmission route for V. parahaemolyticus. This study will be the first biosafety assessment of V. parahaemolyticus in raw vegetables in Malaysia."}

Five indole compounds (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, L-tryptophan, indole-3-acetic acid, melatonin, serotonin) and hypericin were identified and quantified in methanolic extracts of shoot cultures of three Hypericum perforatum cultivars (Helos, Elixir, Topas) growing on two variants of Murashige -Skoog medium differing in concentrations of growth regulators (naphthalene-l-acetic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine). Extracts of the aboveground parts of field-grown plants (Hyperici herba) were also analyzed by HPLC and TLC analysis coupled with densitometric detection. Determination of four compounds was based on our assay described earlier. The methods of determination of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan and hypericin were developed and validated in this study. The composition and contents of the metabolites under study differed between the cultivars cultured in vitro and between medium variants containing diverse contents of growth regulators. The contents of individual indole compounds in the biomass from in vitro cultures ranged from 39.6 to 343.2 mg/100 g dry mass. 5-Hydroxy-L- tryptophan was the dominating metabolite (from 78.2 to 343.2 mg/100 g dry mass). Extracts from shoots of the cultivar Helos also contained high contents of serotonin (319.9 and 197.4 mg/100 g dry mass). The contents of indole compounds in Hyperici herba were also diverse (from 7.1 to 55.3 mg/100 g dry mass). 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan was the dominating metabolite as well. Hypericin content ofHyperici herba, equaling 12.2 mg/100 g dry mass was from 3.3 to 10 times higher than in extracts from shoots cultured in vitro. The present report is the first analysis of endogenous accumulation of indole compounds in Hyperici herba which involves, apart from melatonin, four other compounds."}

Hyperici herba (Hyp) is the aerial part collected during the flowering period from the well-known herb, Hypericum perforatum. Black lipid membrane experiments were performed to investigate the effect of the ethanolic Hyp extract on the electrical properties (capacitance and conductance) of artificial lipid bilayers. Hyp extract (1-10 microg mL(-1)) induced a concentration-dependent increase of both specific transmembrane capacitance and conductance in phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. The effect on conductance was enhanced when the Hyp extract (3 microg mL(-1)) was present on both sides of the membrane (Gm=77.89 +/- 8.81 nS cm(-2), n=5) compared with single-sided application (Gm=36.48 +/- 2.41 nS cm(-2), n=5). In bilayers containing PC and phosphatidylserine (PS), PC:PS, the Hyp extract effect was greater than on pure PC bilayers, although the surface charge was not the determining factor of this enhanced activity. Adding cholesterol to the PC:PS mixture reverted the conductance increase induced by the Hyp extract in a dose-dependent manner. The specific pattern of the Hyp extract interaction with lipid bilayers has possible consequences concerning its absorption and bioavailability, as well as its pharmacodynamic effects on neuronal excitability."}

The central action of a plant extract containing hyperici herba flore extractum siccum has been investigated in freely moving rats during a 6 h exposure with two dosages. After frequency analysis of local field potentials electrical power changes of delta waves and alpha2 waves (less pronounced) could be observed within the frontal cortex and hippocampus. As these frequencies are changed predominantly in the presence of drugs acting at the cholinergic or dopaminergic transmitter system, a similar mode of action can be suspected for this plant extract. Despite the fact that statistical significance could only be observed during the fourth hour (p <0.1), the changes induced by the higher dose of the extract containing 1 mg of hypericine were very stable from the 2. to 4. hour after oral application. Classification of the parameters obtained by means of discriminant analysis revealed a trend into the direction of antidepressive EEG drug profiles. Results suggest that quantitative EEG analysis is a very sensitive methodology for the description of pharmacodynamic actions of plant extracts and data can be compared to the action of pure chemical entities."}

Little is known about the utilization of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) during pregnancy. In Germany, certain preparations of St. John's wort can be reimbursed by statutory health insurances, facilitating to investigate exposure to St. John's wort based on claims data. We therefore aimed to characterize pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and to explore potential malformations in the babies. Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester. There was a dispensation of other antidepressants before pregnancy in 21 % (during pregnancy: 12 %). Eleven percent of pregnancies ended in non-live births. In 312 babies linked to 305 pregnancies, major malformations were coded in 18 babies (5.8 %), of which 17 were exposed in the first trimester. The crude relative risk of major malformations for babies exposed during the first vs. the second or third trimester only was 3.56 (0.48-26.17). Our results suggest that only in a minority of pregnancies, St. John's wort is used as an alternative to other antidepressants. Even though the relatively high rates of non-live births and major malformations after exposure to St. John's wort during the first trimester need to be interpreted with caution, the findings are striking and generate hypotheses that merit further investigation."}

Cocaine use disorder is a serious problem worldwide, and there are no approved medications for its treatment. A novel approach to the treatment of drug addiction is the use of natural products, and, in this context, preclinical evidence suggests that Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericum) is effective against alcohol and other substance use disorders. We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300 mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. All the mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg) and, after extinction of CPP, the reinstating effects of social defeat (alone or with 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg of Hypericum) were evaluated. All the doses of Hypericum prevented the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. Furthermore, the plant extract dose-dependently reduced the reinstating effects of social defeat. Therefore, Hypericum is effective in reducing the rewarding effects of cocaine and prevents the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in mice. The mechanisms underlying these positive effects of Hypericum perforatum L. need to be determined by future research. Our results endorse Hypericum as a natural treatment for cocaine dependence."}

The effect of addition of Potential Metabolite Stimulants (PMSs) - casein acid hydrolysate, meat peptone, salicylic acid, copper sulphate, and silver nitrate, on the concentrations of these saponins and transcript levels of associated genes encoding important biosynthetic enzymes, was assessed in axenic shoot cultures of C. asiatica. Among the stimulants, silver nitrate induced asiaticoside content approximately 6-fold increase in madecassoside levels, after three weeks post-treatment with a decrease in biomass compared to its control. Gene expression analysis of essential genes involved in triterpenoid synthesis such as β-amyrin synthase showed an upregulation of approximately 50-fold at the third week of silver nitrate treatment compared to control.

Hypericum also displays an ample variety of other biological actions, such as hypotensive, analgesic, anti-infective, anti-oxidant, and spasmolytic abilities. However, recent investigations highlighted that this species could be advantageous for the cure of other pathological situations, such as trigeminal neuralgia, as well as in the treatment of cancer. This review focuses on the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), its derivatives, and other Hypericum species in hematologic malignancies. Hypericum induces apoptosis in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. Other Hypericum targets include matrix metalloproteinase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which are mediators of cell migration and angiogenesis. Hypericum also downregulates the expression of proteins that are involved in the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, Hypericum and its derivatives appear to have photodynamic effects and are candidates for applications in tumor photodynamic therapy. Although the in vitro studies appear promising, controlled in vivo studies are necessary before we can hypothesize the introduction of Hypericum and its derivatives into clinical practice for the treatment of hematologic malignancies."}
