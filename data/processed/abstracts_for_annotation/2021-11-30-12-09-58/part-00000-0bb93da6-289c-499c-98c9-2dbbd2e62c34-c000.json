However, improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However, silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus, plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy. Overall, our findings suggest Hyp-1 modulates recalcitrance to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum."}

Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 °C) and light intensity (49-147 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect. The accumulation of melatonin might not be influenced by cultivation conditions. Light intensity and temperature are easily controlled environmental factors in artificial cultivation, both of which are related to secondary metabolite production in the plant. Based on RSM, the optimal conditions for the accumulation of hyperforin and rutin were obtained. The maximum content of hyperforin was 5.6 mg/g, obtained at a temperature of 19 °C, a nutrient solution concentration of 45%, and a light intensity of 49 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PPFD.

However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia.

COVID-19 has become the focal point since 2019 after the outbreak of coronavirus disease. Many drugs are being tested and used to treat coronavirus infections; different kinds of vaccines are also introduced as preventive measure. Alternative therapeutics are as well incorporated into the health guidelines of some countries. This research aimed to look into the underlying mechanisms of functional foods and how they may improve the long-term post COVID-19 cardiovascular, diabetic, and respiratory complications through their bioactive compounds. The potentiality of nine functional foods for post COVID-19 complications was investigated through computational approaches. A total of 266 bioactive compounds of these foods were searched via extensive literature reviewing. Three highly associated targets namely troponin I interacting kinase (TNNI3K), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) were selected for cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, respectively, after COVID-19 infections. Best docked compounds were further analyzed by network pharmacological tools to explore their interactions with complication-related genes (MAPK1 and HSP90AA1 for cardiovascular, PPARG and TNF-alpha for diabetes, and AKT-1 for respiratory disorders). Seventy-one suggested compounds out of one-hundred and thirty-nine (139) docked compounds in network pharmacology recommended 169 Gene Ontology (GO) items and 99 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways preferably AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ACE2 receptor signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway. Among the chosen functional foods, black cumin, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, turmeric, bitter melon, and Indian pennywort were found to modulate the actions. Results demonstrate that aforesaid functional foods have attenuating roles to manage post COVID-19 complications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Functional foods have been approaching a greater interest due to their medicinal uses other than gastronomic pleasure. Nine functional food resources have been used in this research for their traditional and ethnopharmacological uses, but their directive-role in modulating the genes involved in the management of post COVID-19 complications is inadequately studied and reported. Therefore, the foods types used in this research may be prioritized to be used as functional foods for ameliorating the major post COVID-19 complications through appropriate science."}

Plants of the genus <i>Hypericum</i>, commonly known as \"St. John's wort\" (\"spathohorto\" or \"valsamo\" in Greek), have been used since antiquity for their therapeutic properties. Wild-harvested <i>Hypericum</i> plants are still popular today in herbal medicines, commercially exploited due to their bioactive compounds, hypericin and hyperforin, which have antidepressant, antimicrobial and antiviral activity. Species identification of commercial products is therefore important and DNA barcoding, a molecular method that uses small sequences of organisms' genome as barcodes, can be useful in this direction. In this study, we collected plants of the genus <i>Hypericum</i> that grow wild in North-Eastern Greece and explored the efficiency of <i>matK</i>, and <i>trnH-psbA</i> regions as DNA barcodes for their identification. We focused on 5 taxa, namely <i>H. aucheri, H. montbretii, H. olympicum, H. perforatum</i> subsp. <i>perforatum</i>, and <i>H. thasium,</i> the latter a rare Balkan endemic species collected for the first time from mainland Greece. <i>matK</i> (using the genus-specific primers designed herein), <i>trnH-psbA</i>, and their combination were effectively used for the identification of the 5 <i>Hypericum</i> taxa and the discrimination of different <i>H. perforatum</i> subsp. <i>perforatum</i> populations.

Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) constitute a class of oligomeric and polymeric polyphenols with flavan-3-ols as monomeric building blocks. Despite the high impact of proanthocyanidins, these polyphenols are mostly quantified by colorimetric methods or by chromatographic determination of the flavan-3-ols as cleavage products or low molecular oligomers as lead compounds. For St. John's wort (Hyperici herba) from Hypericum perforatum, a protocol for preparative isolation of oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins from an acetone-water extract by chromatography on Sephadex®LH20 in combination with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography on the diol stationary phase was developed, yielding procyanidin reference clusters with a defined degree of polymerization from 3 to 10. Identity and purity of these clusters was proven by high-performance liquid chromatography (RP18 and diol phase) and mass spectrometry. For identification and quantification of proanthocyanidin clusters from St. John's wort, an ICH-Q2 (International harmonized guideline for analytical validation) validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorimetric detection was developed using an acetone-water extract of the herbal material, purified by solid-phase extraction for the removal of naphthodianthrones. The method enabled the quantification of procyanidin clusters with a degree of polymerization from 2 to 10. Analysis of nine batches of Hyperici herba from different sources indicated a high variability of proanthocyanidin content in the range from 8 to 37 mg/g. In all of the batches investigated, the trimer cluster DP3 was the dominant proanthocyanidin (about 40 %), followed by DP 4 (about 15 %) and DP5 (about 12 %). Monitoring of procyanidin distribution during seasonal growth of fresh plants of H. perforatum indicated the highest proanthocyanidin content in young plants (about 50 mg/g) and a time-dependent decrease during the growing season to about 16 mg/g. The highest proanthocyanidin content was found in young leaves and flowers, while the fruits were proanthocyanidin-free; older parts of the stem and the herb had a lower proanthocyanidin content. From these data, it can be concluded that proanthocyanidins serve as part of the plant defense system in the reproductive organs."}

A survey of its presence and relative density in 55 wild blueberry fields was conducted from 2013 to 2016. The objectives of this study were to determine how widespread it is as a weed in wild blueberry and whether it might indirectly contribute to beneficial ecosystem services for wild blueberry. It was found that St. John's wort occurs in about half (45.5%) of all wild blueberry fields surveyed. The crop cycle (prune vs cropping year) affected its relative abundance, significantly less St. John's wort was found in prune fields. St. John's wort relative abundance in wild blueberry fields was not affected by farming system (conventional vs organic) or landscape surrounding blueberry fields. Geographical distribution modeling was performed using the software Maxent. In Maine, the most likely areas predicted to be infested with St. John's wort were the two major blueberry production regions: Mid-coast and Downeast, Maine. Insects associated with St. John's wort were diverse. This weed appears to be under considerable herbivore pressure, especially hemipterans and Chrysolina spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) beetles that have been released for biological control. Insect predators and parasitoids were abundant and may not only reduce herbivory on St. John's wort but may also provide a valuable ecosystem service in terms of predator spillover, resulting in reduction of wild blueberry insect pests.

Centella asiatica (Indian pennywort) has wide application in Indian and Chinese traditional medicines with documented evidence for wound healing and neuroprotective and anti-aging potential. Asiaticoside, a trisaccharide triterpene, is the most medicinally active compound in the plant. β-Amyrin synthase and squalene synthase have been identified as the two key genes in the triterpenoid pathway which regulate the production of asiaticoside in C. asiatica. The paper reports salient findings of our study utilizing the growth-promoting endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica to successfully colonize roots of C. asiatica in vitro cultures for investigating the effect of the mutualistic association on asiaticoside production. Co-cultivation of P. indica resulted in the rapid enhancement of root and shoot biomass of host plant, which was visible after 7 days of culture and continued up to 45 days. P. indica co-cultivation also favored the synthesis of asiaticosides, as evidenced by HPLC analysis which indicated about twofold increase (0.53% (w/w) in leaves and 0.23% (w/w) in whole plant) over control (0.33% (w/w) in leaves and 0.14% (w/w) in whole plant).

Moreover, results from cell culture experiment demonstrated that callus extract possesses promising antioxidant and anti-skin-aging activities. Pre-treatment with callus extract attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced-cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts. The results from RT-qPCR clearly suggested that the upregulation of cellular antioxidant enzymes appeared to be major contributor for the protective effects of callus extract against oxidative stress. Moreover, supplementation with callus extract inhibited induction of matrix metalloprotease-9 following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, suggesting its potential anti-skin-aging activity. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of C. asiatica callus extract as anti-skin-aging agent in cosmeceutical preparations."}

The major challenge associated with the treatment of neurological disorders is the inefficiency of drugs to enter the Central Nervous System (CNS). Polymer-drug conjugates are now being tailored to overcome this hindrance associated with conventional drugs. The study aimed at developing polymer hybrid nasal nanocomposite for enhanced delivery of Centella to the CNS. Thiolated chitosan was complexed with Centella to form a composite using EDAC hydrochloride. The composite was characterized by FTIR, XRD, NMR, and MS. Further, this composite was converted into a nanoformulation by the ionic-gelation method, characterized, and subjected to ex vivo permeation studies. Additionally, MTT assay was performed using Human Uumbilical cord Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) mimicking Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) to establish the safety of nanocomposite. The targeting efficacy was predicted by molecular docking studies against receptors associated with BBB. The FTIR, XRD, NMR, and MS studies confirmed the chemical conjugation of thiolated chitosan with Centella. Nanocomposite characterization through SEM, AFM, and DLS confirmed the size and stability of the developed nanocomposite having a zeta potential of - 14.5 mV and PDI of 0.260. The nanocomposite showed no signs of nasal ciliotoxicity and good permeation of 89.44 ± 1.75% (mean ± SD, n = 3) at 8 h across the nasal mucosa. MTT assay showed that the nanocomposite had lesser toxicity compared to the free drug (IC<sub>50</sub> of Centella-269.1 μg/mL and IC<sub>50</sub> of CTC nanocomposite-485.375 μg/mL). The affinity of polymer to the BBB receptors as proved by docking studies suggests the ability of polymer-based nanocomposite to concentrate in the brain post nasal administration."}

We therefore aimed to characterize pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and to explore potential malformations in the babies. Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester. There was a dispensation of other antidepressants before pregnancy in 21 % (during pregnancy: 12 %). Eleven percent of pregnancies ended in non-live births. In 312 babies linked to 305 pregnancies, major malformations were coded in 18 babies (5.8 %), of which 17 were exposed in the first trimester. The crude relative risk of major malformations for babies exposed during the first vs. the second or third trimester only was 3.56 (0.48-26.17). Our results suggest that only in a minority of pregnancies, St. John's wort is used as an alternative to other antidepressants.

We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300 mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP.
