However, improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However, silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus, plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy. Overall, our findings suggest Hyp-1 modulates recalcitrance to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum."}

Honey bees are highly prone to infectious diseases, causing colony losses in the worst case. However, they combat diseases through a combination of their innate immune system and social defence behaviours like foraging for health-enhancing plant products (e.g. nectar, pollen and resin). Plant secondary metabolites are not only highly active against bacteria and fungi, they might even enhance selective foraging and feeding decisions in the colony. Here, we tested six major plant terpenes and their corresponding acetates, characterizing six natural Thymus vulgaris chemotypes, for their antimicrobial activity on bacteria associated with European foulbrood. Comparison of the inhibitory activity revealed the highest activity for carvacrol and thymol whereas the acetates mostly did not inhibit bacterial growth. All terpenes and acetates are present in the nectar and pollen of thyme, with pollen containing concentrations higher by several orders of magnitude. The physiological response was tested on forager and freshly emerged bees by means of antennal electroantennography. Both responded much stronger to geraniol and trans-sabinene hydrate compared to carvacrol and thymol. In conclusion, bee-forageable thyme product terpenes (mainly from pollen) yield effective antibiotic activity by reducing the growth of bee disease-associated bacteria and can be detected with different response levels by the honey bees' antennae. This is a further step forward in understanding the complex pathogen-pollinator-plant network."}

Triterpene saponins include bioactive compounds with structures consisting of triterpene aglycones (sapogenins) and one or more sugar moieties linked through acetal or ester glycosidic linkages at one or more sites. Centella asiatica (L.) Urban is a medicinal plant that contains bioactive ursane-type saponins, such as madecassoside and asiaticoside. In this work, glucosylation of triterpenoids in C. asiatica was investigated starting with plant extracts. An enzyme capable of glucosylating asiatic and madecassic acids was partially purified. Proteomics methods and cDNA sequence data were employed as tools to obtain a full-length cDNA clone encoding a glucosyltransferase. The recombinant gene product, UGT73AD1, was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography. Purified recombinant UGT73AD1 was found to have a narrow specificity, glucosylating asiatic and madecassic acids at the C28 carboxyl. mRNA accumulated in all tissues tested (leaves, stems, roots and flowers), with highest expression in leaves.

Here, the transcripts of key genes involved in several plant defence responses (secondary metabolites, RNA silencing, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and specific defence genes) were investigated in H. perforatum suspension cells inoculated with A. tumefaciens by quantitative real-time PCR. Results indicated that key genes from the xanthone, hypericin and melatonin biosynthesis pathways, the ROS-detoxification enzyme HpAOX, as well as the defence genes Hyp-1 and HpPGIP, were all upregulated to rapidly respond to A. tumefaciens elicitation in H. perforatum. By contrast, expression levels of genes involved in hyperforin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were markedly downregulated upon A. tumefaciens elicitation. In addition, we compared the expression patterns of key genes in H. perforatum leaf tissues with and without dark glands, a major site of secondary metabolite production.

Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 °C) and light intensity (49-147 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect.

The inhibitory and bactericidal activities of thyme oil against the foodborne multiple antibiotics-resistant Enterococcus faecalis biofilm were evaluated in this study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that more than 70% of the composition of thyme oil is thymol. Crystal violet staining assay showed that 128 and 256 μg/mL thyme oil significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of E. faecalis. The cell adherence of E. faecalis, as shown by its swimming and swarming motilities, was reduced by thyme oil. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) quantification assay showed that thyme oil inhibited the EPS synthesis in E. faecalis biofilms. The 3D-view observations through confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy suggested that cell adherence and biofilm thickness were decreased in thyme oil-treated biofilms. Quantitative real-time analyses showed that the transcription of ebp and epa gene clusters, which were related to cell mobility and EPS production, was inhibited by thyme oil. Thus, thyme oil effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of E. faecalis by affecting cell adherence and EPS synthesis. Furthermore, 2,048 and 4,096 μg/mL thyme oil can effectively inactivate E. faecalis population in the mature E. faecalis biofilms by 5.75 and 7.20 log CFU/mL, respectively, after 30 min of treatment.

In the 60 years since Skoog and Miller first reported the chemical redirection of plant growth the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood, with one challenge being the capacity for applied growth regulators to act indirectly or be metabolized to active phytohormones. We hypothesized that tryptophan is metabolized to auxin, melatonin or serotonin inducing organogenesis in St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.). Root explants from two germplasm lines of St. John's wort with altered melatonin metabolism and wildtype were incubated with auxin or tryptophan for 24, 48 or 72 h to induce regeneration. In wildtype, tryptophan had little effect on the indoleamine pathway, and was found to promote primary growth, suggesting excess tryptophan moved quickly through various secondary metabolite pathways and protein synthesis. In lines 4 and 112 tryptophan was associated with modified morphogenesis, indoleamine and auxin levels. Incubation with tryptophan increased shoot organogenesis while incubation with auxin led to root regeneration. The established paradigm of thought views tryptophan primarily as a precursor for auxin and indoleamines, among other metabolites, and mediation of auxin action by the indoleamines as a one-way interaction. We propose that these processes run in both directions with auxin modifying indoleamine biosynthesis and the melatonin:serotonin balance contributing to its effects on plant morphogenesis, and that tryptophan also functions as an inductive signal to mediate diverse phytochemical and morphogenetic pathways."}

{"pmid":"28885074","text":"Clinical risks of St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) co-administration. St. John's wort (SJW) is a common medicinal herb used for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Hyperforin, one of the chief components of SJW, plays an important role in the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) and P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp), and therefore, affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs. There are several clinical studies demonstrating the interaction of SJW with the metabolism of conventional drugs which may cause life-threatening events. Areas covered: This review focuses on human studies that have evaluated pharmacokinetic alterations of conventional drugs in concomitant use with different SJW preparations. Expert opinion: SJW preparations have demonstrated clinically important interactions with several classes of conventional drugs such as immunosuppressants, anticancer agents, cardiovascular drugs, oral contraceptives, and lipid lowering agents that caused life-threatening events in several cases. The patient information label on the SJW products should provide enough information regarding the possible risk of interaction. Hyperforin seems to be the major ingredient responsible for CYP and P-gp inducing activity of SJW; thus, hyperforin-free products may be future candidates to decrease SJW's drug interactions."}

COVID-19 has become the focal point since 2019 after the outbreak of coronavirus disease. Many drugs are being tested and used to treat coronavirus infections; different kinds of vaccines are also introduced as preventive measure. Alternative therapeutics are as well incorporated into the health guidelines of some countries. This research aimed to look into the underlying mechanisms of functional foods and how they may improve the long-term post COVID-19 cardiovascular, diabetic, and respiratory complications through their bioactive compounds. The potentiality of nine functional foods for post COVID-19 complications was investigated through computational approaches. A total of 266 bioactive compounds of these foods were searched via extensive literature reviewing. Three highly associated targets namely troponin I interacting kinase (TNNI3K), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) were selected for cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory disorders, respectively, after COVID-19 infections. Best docked compounds were further analyzed by network pharmacological tools to explore their interactions with complication-related genes (MAPK1 and HSP90AA1 for cardiovascular, PPARG and TNF-alpha for diabetes, and AKT-1 for respiratory disorders). Seventy-one suggested compounds out of one-hundred and thirty-nine (139) docked compounds in network pharmacology recommended 169 Gene Ontology (GO) items and 99 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways preferably AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ACE2 receptor signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway.

(HuangQi), and <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i> Hook. f. (LeiGongTeng). Though this formula is effective for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in clinic, the exact mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect and antioxidant mechanism of Compound Centella on DKD rats. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied to analyse 3 herbs in Compound Centella. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the normal group (NG), DKD group (DKDG), Compound Centella group (CCG), and losartan group (LG), with 8 rats in each group. On the first day of the experiment, rats in the NG were fed with ordinary -feed, while the other groups were fed with high-fat and high-sugar feed. On the 29<sup>th</sup> day, except the NG, the other 3 groups received a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured on the 1<sup>st</sup> day, 32<sup>nd</sup> day, 46<sup>th</sup> day, 56<sup>th</sup> day, 84<sup>th</sup> day, and 112<sup>th</sup> day. Total protein/creatinine ratio of urine was determined by the phenol red assay on the 1<sup>st</sup> day and 112<sup>th</sup> day. Serum creatinine (Scr) was determined by an automatic biochemical analyser on the 112<sup>th</sup> day. Kidneys were collected on the 112<sup>th</sup> day for analysis and evaluation. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe kidney pathological changes. The mRNA and protein expressions of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in renal tissues were detected by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Oxidative stress was evaluated by detecting the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and heme oxidase-1 (HO-1). The results showed that the content of asiaticoside, astragaloside, and triptolide in the herb was 5960, 809, and 2.42 <i>μ</i>g/g and in the Compound Centella was 340, 64, and 0.1403 <i>μ</i>g/mL by HPLC. Compound Centella reduced the urine protein/creatinine ratio and improved renal pathology in the kidneys of DKD rats. In addition, the mRNA and protein expressions of Keap1 and Nrf2 in kidneys were upregulated by Compound Centella. The expressions of MDA were downregulated but HO-1 were upregulated by Compound Centella. Therefore, the protective effect of Compound Centella in the kidney of DKD rats may be related to regulating the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway under oxidative stress, suggesting Compound Centella as a promising treatment against DKD."}

It is difficult to simultaneously determine five triterpenes because of madecassoside isomers (madecassoside and asiaticoside B), and the great polarity difference between triterpene acid and triterpene glycoside. In this study, a simple high performance liquid chromatography method with isocratic elution employing cyclodextrins (CDs) as the mobile phase additives was developed to determine five triterpenes in C. asiatica. Various factors affecting triterpenes retention in the C18 column, such as the nature of CDs, γ-CD concentration, acetonitrile percentage and temperature, were studied. Experimental results showed that γ-CD, as an effective mobile phase additive, could markedly reduce the retention of triterpenes (especially asiatic acid and madecassic acid), and improve the separation for madecassoside and asiaticoside B. The elution of five triterpenes could be achieved on an ODS C18 column within 30 min using the acetonitrile-0.2% phosphoric acid contained 4.0 mM γ-CD (20:80, v/v) mixture as the mobile phase.

Hence, this study aimed to determine the genetic variability and the essential oil composition of three Korean native thyme, <i>T. quinquecostatus</i> cultivars collected from the Wolchul, Jiri, and Odae mountains, in comparison with six commercial thyme cultivars (<i>T. vulgaris</i>), to distinguish Bak-ri-hyang from other thyme cultivars. The composition of essential oils obtained from nine individuals was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was accomplished using 16 different primers. The GC-MS analysis revealed that Wolchul, creeping, golden, and orange cultivars belong to the geraniol chemotype. Whereas the Odae, lemon, and silver cultivars belong to the thymol chemotype. Further, linalool was the most abundant component in carpet and Jiri cultivars. The RAPD analysis demonstrated that all thyme cultivars showed characteristic RAPD patterns that allowed their identification. In total, 133 bands were obtained using 16 primers, and 124 bands were polymorphic, corresponding to 93.2% polymorphism. Cluster analysis of RAPD markers established the presence of clear separation from nine thyme cultivars. The highest dissimilarity and similarity coefficient of the RAPD markers were 0.58 and 0.98, respectively. According to the RAPD patterns, the nine thyme cultivars could be divided into two major clusters.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of <i>Thymus quinquecostatus</i> Celak extract (TQE) against ALD as well as the underlying mechanism based on gut microbiota and the gut-liver axis. TQE supplementation markedly alleviated chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in C57 mice. TQE also ameliorated gut barrier dysfunction induced by alcohol. Consequently, the activation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation-mediated TLR4 pathway and the subsequent inflammatory response and ROS overproduction in the liver were suppressed. Meanwhile, alcohol-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis was also corrected by TQE. To further investigate the contribution of gut dysbiosis correction to the beneficial effects of TQE on ALD, a fecal microbiota transplantation study was conducted. TQE-manipulated gut microbiota transplantation markedly counteracted the alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis in the recipient mice. In parallel with gut dysbiosis correction, liver damage was partly ameliorated in the recipient mice. Gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia, TLR4 pathway induction as well as downstream inflammatory response and ROS overproduction were also partly suppressed due to gut dysbiosis correction in alcohol-fed recipient mice.

A survey of its presence and relative density in 55 wild blueberry fields was conducted from 2013 to 2016. The objectives of this study were to determine how widespread it is as a weed in wild blueberry and whether it might indirectly contribute to beneficial ecosystem services for wild blueberry. It was found that St. John's wort occurs in about half (45.5%) of all wild blueberry fields surveyed. The crop cycle (prune vs cropping year) affected its relative abundance, significantly less St. John's wort was found in prune fields. St. John's wort relative abundance in wild blueberry fields was not affected by farming system (conventional vs organic) or landscape surrounding blueberry fields. Geographical distribution modeling was performed using the software Maxent. In Maine, the most likely areas predicted to be infested with St. John's wort were the two major blueberry production regions: Mid-coast and Downeast, Maine. Insects associated with St. John's wort were diverse. This weed appears to be under considerable herbivore pressure, especially hemipterans and Chrysolina spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) beetles that have been released for biological control. Insect predators and parasitoids were abundant and may not only reduce herbivory on St. John's wort but may also provide a valuable ecosystem service in terms of predator spillover, resulting in reduction of wild blueberry insect pests.

These naphthodianthrones exist in various forms in Hyperici herba. Protopseudohypericin and protohypericin (protopigments) are converted into pseudohypericin and hypericin (pigments) under the action of light. The aim of this work is to study the influence of light on the phototransformation of protopigments into pigments. Two experiments were carried out. The studies were performed on one hand, on plant material in order to know the proportion of these substances in various plant parts and the possibility of transforming the protopigments into pigments under the action of sunlight; on the other hand, in the extract to determine the optimal wavelength allowing this transformation. Three parts of the fresh plant (buds, flowers, leaves) were treated with sunlight on three levels of exposure. Liquid extracts were exposed to various types of light with wavelengths ranging between 480 and 660 nm by means of diodes. The flowering tops of St. John's Wort contain a share of approximately 30% hypericins in the form of protopseudohypericin and protohypericin: buds (48%), flowers (30%), leaves (17%). After an exposure of fresh buds to sunlight for 16 hours the share of protopigments was then 32%.

The role of HpPGIP in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum overexpressing HpPGIP alone or fused at the N-terminus to Phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a gene that positively modulates resistance to A. tumefaciens. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing was employed to knock down the expression of the PGIP homologous in N. benthamiana. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in both HpPGIP and Hyp-1-PGIP transgenic plants, as assessed by GUS staining assays. However, silencing of PGIP in N. benthamiana increased the resistance to A. tumefaciens rather than susceptibility, which correlated with induction of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs). The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of HpPGIP led to up-regulation of key genes involved in hormone signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, homeostasis of reactive oxygen species, and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Overexpression of Hyp-1-PGIP seemed to enhance the effect of PGIP on the expression of most genes analyzed.

The lipid profile of the broilers was affected by thyme supplementation at 2 and 5 g/kg as represented by a significant decrease in serum cholesterol levels as well as low density lipoprotein levels, which is known to be associated with a corresponding increase in high-density lipoprotein (P ˂ 0.001). Furthermore, supplementation of thyme downregulated the pro-inflammatory mediators and increased the expression of mucin2 mRNA in the jejunum of chickens. It can be concluded that thyme supplementation in the diet of broilers at 5 g/kg has the potential to favorably influence productive performance via an improvement in the immune status of the broiler."}

Eczema is characterized by itching, lichenification, scaling, oedema and erythema. Current management strategies include corticosteroids, which are limited due to side effects. Many herbal remedies are used traditionally but unfortunately have not been validated in controlled clinical trials. Three popular traditional treatments of eczema include Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. In this study three topical formulations (micro emulsion, gel and ointment) were prepared from extracts of Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. These formulations were monitored for stability for a period of three months. Controlled clinical trials were conducted on 360 eczema patients. Clinical parameters observed were degree of erythema, oedema, scaling, itching and lichenification. Effects of each formulation on these clinical parameters were compared with placebo formulations. Micro emulsion formulations in all cases proved to be more effective in reducing semi quantitative scores of erythema and oedema. Itching was relieved more by gel formulation. The ointment showed more efficacy towards scaling and lichenification. Comparison of the effects of placebo and the specific formulations was performed by chi-square statistics and found to be highly significant. In summary it is concluded that all the formulations could be used as promising source for treatment of eczema. "}

Six extracts were obtained from plant species <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L., collected at Samsun in Turkey. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of these extracts. Methanol, ethyl-acetate and hexane were used as a solvents for extraction from both branch-body part of the plant (extracts 1, 2 and 3) and from plant flowers (extracts 4, 5 and 6). The cytotoxic effects of the extracts were determined against 2D and 3D cancer cell models. Cell cycle changes of treated HeLa cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Measurements of gene and microRNA expression levels in treated HeLa cells were done by quantitative real time PCR. Five examined extracts (2-6) exerted selective concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects on HeLa, K562, and A549 cancer cells, while the extract 1 exhibited very weak cytotoxicity. The extract 6 showed the highest intensity of cytotoxic activity. All tested extracts (2-6) demonstrated the ability to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells through activation of caspase-3. These extracts remarkably decreased gene expression levels of <i>MMP2</i>, <i>MMP9</i>, <i>TIMP3</i>, and <i>VEGFA</i> in HeLa cells. Flower extracts might have stronger effects on miR128/193a-5p/335 level changes than branch-body extracts. <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> extracts exerted weaker cytotoxic effects on 3D HeLa spheroids when compared with their effects on 2D monolayer HeLa cells.

In this study, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the phytomass and triterpenoid production of diploid and tetraploid Centella asiatica hairy roots were investigated. Hairy root cultures were obtained from diploid and induced tetraploid plants of C. asiatica infected by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain ATCC 43057. MeJA triggered triterpenoid production in both ploidy hairy roots, whereas triterpenoids were not produced in the untreated hairy roots. Among the treatments, the 50 µM MeJA treatment yielded the maximum triterpenoid production in diploid hairy roots of 27.25 ± 0.27 µg/mg Dry weight (DW) total triterpenoid at day 21. For the tetraploid hairy root cultures, the 28th-day hairy root culture produced a maximum amount of triterpenoids of 16.29 ± 6.32 µg/mg DW in response to the 50 µM MeJA treatment, whereas the 100 µM MeJA treatment produced a similar triterpenoid amount (16.31 ± 9.24 µg/mg DW) at day 14. Moreover, in response to 50 µM MeJA, we obtained different ratios of aglycone to glycoside, i.e., 1:7 and 1:2, between the diploid and tetraploid hairy root cultures.

Nutritional strategies, particularly herbal extracts, play a crucial importance in this scenario. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a novel selected mixture (hereafter refers to as Stress-Bio-Max, SBM) comprising St John's wort, lavender, Melissa officinalis extracts, betaine, and Vit C on heat-stressed broilers. A total of 300 male broiler chicks were allocated to 4 treatments: T1, Control (no SBM in drinking water); T2, 0.25 mL/L of SBM in drinking water; T3, 0.5 and T4, 1 mL/L of SBM, which applied since d 32. The birds underwent heat stress (40 ± 1) daily from d 35 to 42 of the experiment (2 pm-8 pm). The results show the superior weight gain of T2 and T3 from d 7 to 42 compared to other groups, 72.5 and 72.7 g/d, respectively (P < 0.05).

Since dissociation of the homotetrameric protein to its monomers is crucial in its amyloidogenesis, stabilizing the native tetramer from dissociating using small-molecule ligands has proven a viable therapeutic strategy. The objective of this study was to determine the potential role of the medicinal herb <i>Centella asiatica</i> on human transthyretin (huTTR) amyloidogenesis. Thus, we investigated the stability of huTTR with or without a hydrophilic fraction of <i>C. asiatica</i> (CAB) against acid/urea-mediated denaturation. We also determined the influence of CAB on huTTR fibrillation using transmission electron microscopy. The potential binding interactions between CAB and huTTR was ascertained by nitroblue tetrazolium redox-cycling and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid displacement assays. Additionally, the chemical profile of CAB was determined by liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). Our results strongly suggest that CAB bound to and preserved the quaternary structure of huTTR in vitro. CAB also prevented transthyretin fibrillation, although aggregate formation was unmitigated.

We have recently demonstrated that Hypericum perforatum root cultures constitutively produce xanthones at higher levels than the root of the plant and that they respond to chitosan (CHIT) elicitation with a noteworthy increase in xanthone production. In the present study, CHIT was administered to H. perforatum root cultures using three different elicitation protocols, and the increase in xanthone production was evaluated. The best results (550 % xanthone increase) were obtained by subjecting the roots to a single elicitation with 200 mg l(-1) CHIT and maintaining the elicitor in the culture medium for 7 days. To discriminate the effect of CHIT from that of the solvent, control experiments were performed by administering AcOH alone at the same concentration used for CHIT solubilization. Unexpectedly, AcOH caused an increase in xanthone production comparable to that observed in response to CHIT. Feeding experiments with (13)C-labeled AcOH demonstrated that this compound was not incorporated into the xanthone skeleton. Other short-chain monocarboxylic acids (i.e., propionic and butyric acid) have little or no effect on the production of xanthones.

Thyme is a natural product which is consisted of multiple phenolic compounds of therapeutic significance for treatment of cough and bronchitis. This study evaluated the efficacy of thyme oil against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced BA in an experimental rabbit model. Forty male rabbits were divided into four equal groups [control group (G1), OVA (G2), thyme oil (G3), and OVA plus thyme oil (G4)]. Animals were treated for 30 days, and clinical, histopathological (HP), histochemical (HC), immunohistochemical (IHC), morphometric, biochemical and flow cytometry methods were performed, followed by statistical analysis. All used methods revealed normal structure of the lung tissues in rabbits of G1 and G3. In contrast, the clinical examination of G2 rabbits revealed an obvious increase in the respiratory rate, sneezing and wheezing, whereas the HP, HC and IHC techniques exhibited substantial inflammatory changes in the peribronchio-vascular lung tissues with thinning, degeneration, apoptosis (using the TUNEL assay), necrosis, and shedding of the airway epithelium. Furthermore, the morphometric results confirmed significant increases in the numbers of inflammatory cells, goblet cells, eosinophils and apoptotic cells from (12, 0, 2, 2 cells) to (34,10, 16, 18 cells) respectively, as well as the area percentage of collagen fiber deposition and immunoexpression of eotaxin-1/10 high power fields.

The discovery of new antibiotics that are effective against Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteralesis a research priority. Several essential oils (EOs) have displayed some antimicrobial activity and could potentially act as antibiotic adjuvants. Research in this area aims to develop new therapeutic alternatives to treat infections caused by these pathogens. MICs of different EOs were determined against A. baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays were used to study the synergy between the EOs and antibiotics. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC<sub>index</sub>) was calculated in order to categorize the interaction. Time-kill assays were also performed. The EOs that displayed the highest levels of antimicrobial activity were clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and thyme (Thymus zygis L.). Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays revealed synergy between these EOs and colistin. Addition of either clove or thyme EO decreased the MIC of colistin by 8- to 64-fold and 8- to 128-fold in the colistin-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively (FIC<sub>index</sub> ≤ 0.5, synergy). MICs were also reduced in the colistin-susceptible strains. Time-kill assays also indicated the strong activity of the combined therapy. In summary, the use of clove or thyme EO in combination with colistin could improve the efficacy of the antibiotic and significantly reduce the concentrations needed to inhibit growth of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae."}

Obesity is a low-grade inflammatory disease that is getting increasingly common among adults and children and causes different complications. Insulin resistance, Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome and hypertension are among the major health problems, that are associated with obesity. Some medications are used to treat obese individuals and metabolic surgery is recommended, if appropriate, for individuals with a BMI ≥ 40. Due to the fact that medications and metabolic surgery are not tolerated by all, researchers focus on alternative therapies. Medicinal plants comprise the most important group of these alternative treatments. Hypericum perforatum L. is the medicinal plant, which we focused on in this study. Hypericum perforatum L. has been recognized as a medicinally valuable plant for over 2000 years. It has been used for generations to treat anxiety, depression, insomnia, gastritis, hemorrhoids, wounds, and burns. Recent studies have indeed shown promising effects for the treatment of obesity. In this study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to mimic the adipocyte differentiation associated with obesity in cellular terms.

Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) is known to produce a variety of phenolic monoterpenes such as thymol and carvacrol. Thymol and carvacrol are health-promoting, biocide and antitoxin compounds and have been considered as the main constituents of essential oils in T. vulgaris. To improve our understanding of the regulation of monoterpene biosynthesis in thyme, the expression of genes related to thymol and carvacrol biosynthesis in different tissues and in response to abiotic elicitors was analyzed. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), trans-cinnamic acid (tCA) and UV-C irradiation were applied to T. vulgare leaves and transcript levels of early (DXR) and late (TvTPS1, CYP71D178 and CYP71D180) biosynthetic genes of thymol and carvacrol were measured. The results showed that early step and late step genes in thymol/carvacrol biosynthesis are differentially regulated. DXR was not found to be exclusively expressed in glandular trichomes; in contrast, biosynthetic genes including γ-terpinene synthase (TvTPS1) and two cytochrome P450s, CYP71D178 and CYP71D180, were preferentially expressed in glandular secretory trichomes. The high expression of late biosynthetic genes in glandular trichomes, which also contain the highest concentration of thymol and carvacrol, suggests that glandular trichomes are the structure in which thymol/carvacrol biosynthesis and accumulation occur. Our results indicate that in addition to abiotic elicitors, developmental and spatial factors also play a key role in the biosynthesis of thymol and carvacrol, most likely relating to glandular trichome density and/or activity. Hence optimization of these factors could be considered as a useful strategy to achieve high yield of valuable compounds in T. vulgare or other closely related plant species."}

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dairy cow diet supplementation with thyme oil and its main component thymol on intake and total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients, rumen fermentation characteristics, ruminal protozoa, nitrogen excretion, and milk production. For this aim, we used 8 multiparous, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design (28 d periods), balanced for residual effects. Cows were fed 1 of the 4 following experimental treatments: total mixed ration (TMR) with no additive (control); TMR + monensin [24 mg/kg of dry matter (DM)]; TMR + thyme oil (50 mg/kg of DM); and TMR + thymol (50 mg/kg of DM). Compared with the control diet, feeding thyme oil or thymol had no effect on DM intake, nutrient total-tract apparent digestibility, total N excretion, ruminal pH, ammonia concentration, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, or acetate:propionate ratio. Ruminal protozoa density was not modified by thyme oil, but decreased with thymol supplementation. Supplementation with thyme oil or thymol did not affect milk production, milk composition, or efficiency of milk production. Neither thyme oil nor thymol affected efficiency of dietary N use for milk N secretion (N intake/milk N). Supplementation with monensin tended to decrease DM intake (-1.2 kg/d) and milk fat yield. Total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients did not differ between cows fed monensin and cows fed the control diet. Total VFA concentration was not changed by monensin supplementation compared with control, but adding monensin shifted the VFA profile toward more propionate and less acetate, resulting in a decrease of acetate:propionate ratio. Protozoa density and ammonia concentration were lower in the ruminal content of cows fed monensin compared with that of cows fed the control diet. Total N excretion was not affected by monensin supplementation. Likewise, efficiency of use of dietary N for milk N secretion was unchanged in cows fed monensin. The results of this study contrasted with the claimed in vitro antimicrobial activity of thyme oil and thymol: we observed no positive effects on rumen metabolism (i.e., N and VFA) or milk performance in dairy cows.

Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester.

Also, the macro- and micro-nutrients of thyme leaves increased significantly in intercropping patterns after application of AMF. The maximum essential oil percentage of thyme was achieved in 50:50 intercropping ratio treated with AMF. Under moderate and severe water deficits, the major constituents of thyme essential oil including thymol, p-cymene and γ-terpinene were increased in intercropping patterns treated with AMF. Generally, AMF application in intercropping ratio of 50:50 may be proposed to farmers as an eco-friendly approach to achieve desirable essential oil quality and quantity in thyme under water deficit stress conditions."}

Cocaine use disorder is a serious problem worldwide, and there are no approved medications for its treatment. A novel approach to the treatment of drug addiction is the use of natural products, and, in this context, preclinical evidence suggests that Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericum) is effective against alcohol and other substance use disorders. We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300 mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. All the mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg) and, after extinction of CPP, the reinstating effects of social defeat (alone or with 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg of Hypericum) were evaluated. All the doses of Hypericum prevented the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. Furthermore, the plant extract dose-dependently reduced the reinstating effects of social defeat. Therefore, Hypericum is effective in reducing the rewarding effects of cocaine and prevents the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in mice. The mechanisms underlying these positive effects of Hypericum perforatum L. need to be determined by future research. Our results endorse Hypericum as a natural treatment for cocaine dependence."}

Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) is widely used as a traditional spice in the cooking of goat meat (mutton) due to its distinctive flavor and the ability to weaken the \"goaty flavor\". To investigate the aroma characteristics of stewed mutton with thyme (SMT), four SMT samples prepared using different cooking utensils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O). Totally, 26 aroma-active compounds (AACs) were determined by GC-MS/O and further quantified. Among these, 20 AACs exhibited odor activity values (OAV) greater than 1. However, no significant differences existed among the four SMTs, which indicated that different utensils had little effect on the aroma profile of SMTs. Aroma recombination and omission experiments results showed that nonanal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal had the greatest contribution to the aroma profile of SMTs. These three compounds, together with dimethyl trisulfide, 3-methyl-butanal, octanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-nonenal, methanethiol, hexanal, (E)-2-undecenal, and 1-octen-3-ol, were confirmed as the key aroma compounds in SMTs."}

The triterpenoid saponins, asiaticoside and madecassoside from Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. are known to have a wide range of applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The effect of addition of Potential Metabolite Stimulants (PMSs) - casein acid hydrolysate, meat peptone, salicylic acid, copper sulphate, and silver nitrate, on the concentrations of these saponins and transcript levels of associated genes encoding important biosynthetic enzymes, was assessed in axenic shoot cultures of C. asiatica. Among the stimulants, silver nitrate induced asiaticoside content approximately 6-fold increase in madecassoside levels, after three weeks post-treatment with a decrease in biomass compared to its control. Gene expression analysis of essential genes involved in triterpenoid synthesis such as β-amyrin synthase showed an upregulation of approximately 50-fold at the third week of silver nitrate treatment compared to control. These findings suggest that silver nitrate can act as a metabolite stimulant, to enhance the formation of triterpenoids in axenic shoot culture of C. asiatica, which could be utilized in studying the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis and biotechnological application for the increased production of these bioactive molecules."}

Chemical characterization and CAP phytoconstituent profile was obtained by colorimetric and UHPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS analysis, respectively. Our data show that CAP attenuated the formation of fluorescent AGEs (38.5%), Dityrosine (44.6%), N-formylkynurenine (42.9%), Amadori products, and resisted structural alterations of BSA subjected to glycation. These effects could be due to the antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of CAP mediated by the presence of phenolics and triterpenoids.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important beneficial target for AD to control cholinergic signaling deficit. <i>Centella asiatica</i> (CA) has proven to be rich with active ingredients for memory enhancement. In the present study, the chemical profiling of three accession extracts of CA namely SECA-K017, SECA-K018, and, SECA-K019 were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four biomarker triterpene compounds were detected in all CA accessions. Quantitative analysis reveals that madecassoside was the highest triterpene in all the CA accessions. The biomarker compounds and the ethanolic extracts of three accessions were investigated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity using Ellman's spectrophotometer method. The inhibitory activity of the triterpenes and accession extracts was compared with the standard AChE inhibitor eserine. The results from the in vitro study showed that the triterpene compounds exhibited an AChE inhibitory activity with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values between 15.05 ± 0.05 and 59.13 ± 0.18 µg/mL.
