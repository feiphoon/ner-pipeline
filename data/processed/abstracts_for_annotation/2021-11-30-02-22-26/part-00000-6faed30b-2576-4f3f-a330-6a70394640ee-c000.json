{"pmid":"30279427","text":"The terpenes of leaves, pollen, and nectar of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) inhibit growth of bee disease-associated microbes. Honey bees are highly prone to infectious diseases, causing colony losses in the worst case. However, they combat diseases through a combination of their innate immune system and social defence behaviours like foraging for health-enhancing plant products (e.g. nectar, pollen and resin). Plant secondary metabolites are not only highly active against bacteria and fungi, they might even enhance selective foraging and feeding decisions in the colony. Here, we tested six major plant terpenes and their corresponding acetates, characterizing six natural Thymus vulgaris chemotypes, for their antimicrobial activity on bacteria associated with European foulbrood. Comparison of the inhibitory activity revealed the highest activity for carvacrol and thymol whereas the acetates mostly did not inhibit bacterial growth. All terpenes and acetates are present in the nectar and pollen of thyme, with pollen containing concentrations higher by several orders of magnitude. The physiological response was tested on forager and freshly emerged bees by means of antennal electroantennography. Both responded much stronger to geraniol and trans-sabinene hydrate compared to carvacrol and thymol. In conclusion, bee-forageable thyme product terpenes (mainly from pollen) yield effective antibiotic activity by reducing the growth of bee disease-associated bacteria and can be detected with different response levels by the honey bees' antennae. This is a further step forward in understanding the complex pathogen-pollinator-plant network."}

Thymus quinquecostatus, with more medical value, is a kind of wild plants. In order to exploit and utilize this plant, we studied the species and locations of alkaloids in its leaves. In this paper, histochemical study of leaves at different developing stages was taken to localize the alkaloids. Meanwhile, the kinds and content of alkaloids in leaves were identified using GC-MS technique. It was found that there were two kinds of glandular trichomes, namely, peltate trichomes and capitate trichomes, on the surface of leaves, and their secretory cells could secrete alkaloids. Results showed that trichomes could secrete alkaloids as soon as the first pair of leaves formed, and there were altogether 18 kinds of alkaloids identified by GC-MS. Nearly all of these alkaloids of leaves at different developing stages were distinct from each other, except one, 3-methoxy-a-methyl-benzeneethanamine, persists at different developing stages with high concentration.

Three morphologically distinct types of glandular trichomes are described. Peltate trichomes, consisting of a basal cell, a stalk cell and a 12-celled head, are distributed on the stem, leaf, corolla and outer side of calyx. Capitate trichomes, consisting of a unicellular base, a 1-2-celled stalk and a unicellular head, are distributed more diffusely than peltate ones, existing on stem, leaf, rachis and calyx. Digitiform trichomes are just distributed on the outer side of corolla, consisting of 1 basal cell, 3 stalk cells and 1 head cell. All three types of glandular trichomes can secrete essential oil, and in small capitate trichomes of rachis, all peltate trichomes and digitiform trichomes, essential oil is stored in a large subcuticular space, released by cuticle rupture, whereas, in other capitate trichomes, essential oil crosses the thin cuticle.

Minced pork containing different concentrations (0%, 0.3%, 0.6%, or 0.9%) of thyme (TEO) or oregano essential oil (OEO) and packaged under vacuum or modified atmosphere (MAP) (30%O<sub>2</sub> /50%CO<sub>2</sub> /20%N<sub>2</sub> ) was evaluated within 15 days of refrigeration (3 ± 1 °C) storage. EOs were examined for scavenging capacity toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, nitric oxide radicals, and hydroxyl, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (butylated hydroxytoluene was used as positive controls). The order of antioxidative effectiveness was as follows: butylated hydroxytoluene > OEO > TEO, with significant differences between agents (P < 0.05). Lipid oxidation in meat was determined by monitoring malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and lipolysis was assessed by measuring the acidity index immediately and after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days of storage. EOs significantly (P < 0.05) increased the stability of minced pork with respect to lipid oxidation compared with the control, and the antioxidative effect was dose-dependent. Moreover, vacuum packaging resulted in mince with significantly lower oxidation and lipolysis levels than modified atmosphere packaged mince (P < 0.05). The results demonstrate that both EOs examined effectively reduced lipid oxidation in raw pork mince after 2 weeks' storage.

Crystal violet staining assay showed that 128 and 256 μg/mL thyme oil significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of E. faecalis. The cell adherence of E. faecalis, as shown by its swimming and swarming motilities, was reduced by thyme oil. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) quantification assay showed that thyme oil inhibited the EPS synthesis in E. faecalis biofilms. The 3D-view observations through confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy suggested that cell adherence and biofilm thickness were decreased in thyme oil-treated biofilms. Quantitative real-time analyses showed that the transcription of ebp and epa gene clusters, which were related to cell mobility and EPS production, was inhibited by thyme oil. Thus, thyme oil effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of E. faecalis by affecting cell adherence and EPS synthesis.

The economic evaluation showed that birds fed on 8 g/kg thyme yielded the lowest net revenue and highest feed cost to produce 1 kg of live weight compared to the other treatments, while birds fed on 2 and 5 g/kg thyme did not differ significantly from values obtained for the controls. The lipid profile of the broilers was affected by thyme supplementation at 2 and 5 g/kg as represented by a significant decrease in serum cholesterol levels as well as low density lipoprotein levels, which is known to be associated with a corresponding increase in high-density lipoprotein (P ˂ 0.001). Furthermore, supplementation of thyme downregulated the pro-inflammatory mediators and increased the expression of mucin2 mRNA in the jejunum of chickens. It can be concluded that thyme supplementation in the diet of broilers at 5 g/kg has the potential to favorably influence productive performance via an improvement in the immune status of the broiler."}

Thyme is a natural product which is consisted of multiple phenolic compounds of therapeutic significance for treatment of cough and bronchitis. This study evaluated the efficacy of thyme oil against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced BA in an experimental rabbit model. Forty male rabbits were divided into four equal groups [control group (G1), OVA (G2), thyme oil (G3), and OVA plus thyme oil (G4)]. Animals were treated for 30 days, and clinical, histopathological (HP), histochemical (HC), immunohistochemical (IHC), morphometric, biochemical and flow cytometry methods were performed, followed by statistical analysis. All used methods revealed normal structure of the lung tissues in rabbits of G1 and G3. In contrast, the clinical examination of G2 rabbits revealed an obvious increase in the respiratory rate, sneezing and wheezing, whereas the HP, HC and IHC techniques exhibited substantial inflammatory changes in the peribronchio-vascular lung tissues with thinning, degeneration, apoptosis (using the TUNEL assay), necrosis, and shedding of the airway epithelium. Furthermore, the morphometric results confirmed significant increases in the numbers of inflammatory cells, goblet cells, eosinophils and apoptotic cells from (12, 0, 2, 2 cells) to (34,10, 16, 18 cells) respectively, as well as the area percentage of collagen fiber deposition and immunoexpression of eotaxin-1/10 high power fields.

Higher total powder yield (based on the dry weight prior to extraction) was achieved by freeze than spray drying and lower loss of total polyphenol content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) due to the drying process. Gelatin as a coating agent (5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>) provided better TPC recovery by 70% in case of lyophilization and higher total powder yield in case of spray drying by diminishing material deposition on the wall of the drying chamber.

Cows were fed 1 of the 4 following experimental treatments: total mixed ration (TMR) with no additive (control); TMR + monensin [24 mg/kg of dry matter (DM)]; TMR + thyme oil (50 mg/kg of DM); and TMR + thymol (50 mg/kg of DM). Compared with the control diet, feeding thyme oil or thymol had no effect on DM intake, nutrient total-tract apparent digestibility, total N excretion, ruminal pH, ammonia concentration, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, or acetate:propionate ratio. Ruminal protozoa density was not modified by thyme oil, but decreased with thymol supplementation. Supplementation with thyme oil or thymol did not affect milk production, milk composition, or efficiency of milk production. Neither thyme oil nor thymol affected efficiency of dietary N use for milk N secretion (N intake/milk N). Supplementation with monensin tended to decrease DM intake (-1.2 kg/d) and milk fat yield. Total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients did not differ between cows fed monensin and cows fed the control diet. Total VFA concentration was not changed by monensin supplementation compared with control, but adding monensin shifted the VFA profile toward more propionate and less acetate, resulting in a decrease of acetate:propionate ratio. Protozoa density and ammonia concentration were lower in the ruminal content of cows fed monensin compared with that of cows fed the control diet. Total N excretion was not affected by monensin supplementation. Likewise, efficiency of use of dietary N for milk N secretion was unchanged in cows fed monensin. The results of this study contrasted with the claimed in vitro antimicrobial activity of thyme oil and thymol: we observed no positive effects on rumen metabolism (i.e., N and VFA) or milk performance in dairy cows.

{"pmid":"32585989","text":"Antioxidative Effects of <i>Thymus quinquecostatus</i> CELAK through Mitochondrial Biogenesis Improvement in RAW 264.7 Macrophages. Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have reported that mitochondrial dysfunction is a leading cause of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial changes play an important role in preventing oxidative stress. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. <i>Thymus quinquecostatus</i> CELAK (TQC) extract is a plant from China belonging to the thymus species, which can mediate the inflammatory response and prevent cell damage through its antioxidant activities. This study examines whether TQC can scavenge excess ROS originating from the mitochondria in RAW 264.7 macrophages. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation and oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 macrophages and performed an immunocytochemistry dot blot of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and real-time PCR to analyze the expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. TQC was found to significantly reduce the intensity of immunostained MitoSOX and 8-OHdG levels in the total genomic DNA within the mitochondria in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The HO-1 and Nrf2 mRNA levels were also significantly increased in the TQC groups. Therefore, we verified that TQC improves mitochondrial function and attenuates oxidative stress induced by LPS. Our results can provide reference for the effect of TQC to develop new therapeutic strategies for various diseases."}

Intercropping of medicinal plants/legumes along with bio-fertilizer application is a relatively new sustainable practice for improving the yield and secondary metabolites production. Here, a 2-years field experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of water deficit stress and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) application (as bio-fertilizer) on nutrients concentration, dry matter yield, essential oil quantity and quality of thyme in intercropping with soybean. Three irrigation levels, including (i) irrigation after depletion of 20% (I<sub>20</sub>) as non-stressed, 50% (I<sub>50</sub>) as moderate water deficit and 80% (I<sub>80</sub>) available water as severe water deficit were applied as the main factor. The sub-factor was represented by different cropping patterns including thyme sole culture, replacement intercrop ratio of 50:50 and 66:34 (soybean: thyme) and the third factor was non-usage (control) and usage of AMF. According to our results, the thyme dry yield under moderate and severe water deficit stress decreased by 35 and 44% in the first year, and by 27 and 40% in the second year compared with non-stressed (I<sub>20</sub>) plants, respectively. Also, the macro- and micro-nutrients of thyme leaves increased significantly in intercropping patterns after application of AMF. The maximum essential oil percentage of thyme was achieved in 50:50 intercropping ratio treated with AMF. Under moderate and severe water deficits, the major constituents of thyme essential oil including thymol, p-cymene and γ-terpinene were increased in intercropping patterns treated with AMF. Generally, AMF application in intercropping ratio of 50:50 may be proposed to farmers as an eco-friendly approach to achieve desirable essential oil quality and quantity in thyme under water deficit stress conditions."}

Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) is widely used as a traditional spice in the cooking of goat meat (mutton) due to its distinctive flavor and the ability to weaken the \"goaty flavor\". To investigate the aroma characteristics of stewed mutton with thyme (SMT), four SMT samples prepared using different cooking utensils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O). Totally, 26 aroma-active compounds (AACs) were determined by GC-MS/O and further quantified. Among these, 20 AACs exhibited odor activity values (OAV) greater than 1. However, no significant differences existed among the four SMTs, which indicated that different utensils had little effect on the aroma profile of SMTs. Aroma recombination and omission experiments results showed that nonanal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal had the greatest contribution to the aroma profile of SMTs. These three compounds, together with dimethyl trisulfide, 3-methyl-butanal, octanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-nonenal, methanethiol, hexanal, (E)-2-undecenal, and 1-octen-3-ol, were confirmed as the key aroma compounds in SMTs."}

In this study, novel near-infrared and attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopic methods coupled with multivariate data analysis were established enabling the determination of thymol, rosmarinic acid, and the antioxidant capacity of Thymi herba. A new high-performance liquid chromatography method and UV-Vis spectroscopy were applied as reference methods. Partial least squares regressions were carried out as cross and test set validations. To reduce systematic errors, different data pretreatments, such as multiplicative scatter correction, 1st derivative, or 2nd derivative, were applied on the spectra. The performances of the two infrared spectroscopic techniques were evaluated and compared. In general, attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy demonstrated a slightly better predictive power (thymol: coefficient of determination = 0.93, factors = 3, ratio of performance to deviation = 3.94; rosmarinic acid: coefficient of determination = 0.91, factors = 3, ratio of performance to deviation = 3.35, antioxidant capacity: coefficient of determination = 0.87, factors = 2, ratio of performance to deviation = 2.80; test set validation) than near-infrared spectroscopy (thymol: coefficient of determination = 0.90, factors = 6, ratio of performance to deviation = 3.10; rosmarinic acid: coefficient of determination = 0.92, factors = 6, ratio of performance to deviation = 3.61, antioxidant capacity: coefficient of determination = 0.91, factors = 6, ratio of performance to deviation = 3.42; test set validation).

Available in Pharmacies in Poland: Short Communication. Scientific reports about elemental impurities in final pharmaceutical products are essential from a regulatory point of view; unfortunately, there is a lack of studies about this important toxicological topic. The aim of our short communication was determination of total Cr impurities in traditional herbal medicinal products (THMP) with Thymi herba (Thymus vulgaris L. and Thymus zygis L.) available in Polish pharmacies (n = 6, because only six manufacturers produce this kind of pharmaceutical products in Poland). The total content of Cr impurities was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using electrothermal atomization (ETAAS). Applied comprehensive toxicological risk assessment was based on three main tiers: Tier 1, the comparison of raw results as total Cr impurities profile (metal per L of THMP) with ICH Q3D guideline standards; Tier 2, the estimation of total Cr exposure with a single dose; and Tier 3, the estimation of total Cr daily exposure. We confirmed that total Cr impurities were present in all analyzed THMP with thymi herba (the observed level was below 6.0 µg/L). Total Cr concentration in a single dose can be deceptively high in comparison to the raw results but is not a threat to patients (20.15-63.45 ng/single dose). Moreover, the estimation of total Cr daily exposure shows that all analyzed THMP are characterized by daily dose (40.30-181.41 ng/day) below PDE value (10,700 mg/day); hence, all products meet the standards of ICH Q3D elemental impurities guideline."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antioxidative activities of water and 70% ethanolic extracts from the Thymus quinquecostatus Celak (TQC) for natural antioxidant source. The antioxidant activities were compared with other natural and synthetic antioxidants. The levels of total polyphenols and flavonoids were also determined. The extracts were found to have different levels of antioxidant properties in a few kind of assay. The results showed that higher radical scavenging activity, reducing power and antioxidant capacity in FRAP than those of BHT as a positive control. In addition, the extracts from the TQC leaf and stem showed stronger antioxidant activity than that of vitamin C, α-tocopherol in ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) methods. Cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effect of water extracts from TQC was also prevented t-BHP-induced toxicity in Chang liver cells. Therefore, these results indicate that TQC extracts have antioxidant properties through its ability to enhance the cell viability, reduction of production of ROS, inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondria dysfunction and ultimately inhibition of cell apoptosis. Based on the results described above, it is suggested that TQC has the potential to protect liver on t-BHP-induced cell damage and should be considered as a prospective functional food."}
