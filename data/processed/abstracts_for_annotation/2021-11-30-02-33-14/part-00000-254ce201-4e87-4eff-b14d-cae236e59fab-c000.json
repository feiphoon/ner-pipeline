Aiming to fill a need for data regarding radiocesium transport via both branchflow and stemflow through forests impacted by radioactive fallout, this study examined the vertical variation of radiocesium flux from branchflow and stemflow through the canopies of young Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica (L. f.) D. Don) and Japanese oak (Quercus serrata Murray) trees in the aftermath of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In forested areas approximately 40 km northwest of the location of the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, the <sup>137</sup>Cs concentration varied significantly among sampling periods and between the two forests, with the oak stand exhibiting higher <sup>137</sup>Cs concentrations and depositional fluxes than the cedar stand. Expressed per unit trunk basal area, the depositional flux of <sup>137</sup>Cs generated from the cedar and oak stands was 375 and 2810 Bq m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Of this total, 71% and 48% originated from the cedar and oak canopy, respectively, while the remainder originated from the trunk. Accordingly, the origin of radiocesium was more balanced for the oak stand with almost half of the flux coming from the canopy (48%) and the other half from the trunk (52%). Only about a quarter (29%) of the radiocesium flux originated from the trunk in Japanese cedar. Results from this work provide needed data that can enable a more thorough conceptualization of radiocesium cycling in forests. Coupling these empirical results with a physically-based model would likely lead to better forest management and proactive strategies for rehabilitating radioactively-contaminated forests and reducing the exposure risk of radiation dose rate for those that utilize forest products."}

Rehder and Quercus serrata Murray were estimated for their wood properties such as calorific value, density, moisture content and ash content from a sub-tropical forest of Haraothel hill, Senapati District, Manipur. Wood biomass components were found to have higher calorific value (kJ g(-)) than bark components. The calorific values for tree species were found highest in L. pachyphyllus (17.99 kJ g(-1)) followed by C. indica (17.98 kJ g1), L. fenestratus (17.96 kJ g\"), L. polystachyus (17.80 kJ g(-1)) and Q. serrata (17.49 kJ g(-1)). Calorific values for bole bark, bole wood and branch bark were found significantly different (F > 3.48 at p = 0.05) in five oak tree species. Percentage of ash on dry weight basis was found to be highest in Q. serrata (4.73%) and lowest in C. indica (2.19%). Ash content of tree components gives a singnificant factor in determining fuelwood value index (FVI). Of all the five oak tree species, Q. serrata exhibited highest value of wood density (0.78 g cm-) and lowest was observed in C. indica (0.63 g cm(-3)). There was significant correlation between wood density (p<0.05), ash content (p<0.01) with calorific value in oak tree species. Fuelwood value index (FVI) was in the following order: C. indica (1109.70) > L. pachyphyllus (898.41)> L. polystachyus (879.02)> L. fenestratus (824.61)> Q. serrata (792.50).

Bokusoku (BK) is an extract from the Quercus cortex used in folk medicine for treatment of skin disorders and convergence, and is present in jumihaidokuto, a traditional Japanese medicine that is prescribed for purulent skin diseases like acne vulgaris. The excess of sebum production induced by androgen is involved in the development of acne. Our aim is to examine whether BK and its constituents inhibit testosterone metabolism and testosterone-induced sebum synthesis. Methods. Measurements of 5α-reductase activity and lipogenesis were performed using rat liver microsomes and hamster sebocytes, respectively. Results. BK dose-dependently reduced the conversion of testosterone to a more active androgen, dihydrotestosterone in a 5α-reductase enzymatic reaction. Twenty polyphenols in BK categorized as gallotannin, ellagitannin, and flavonoid were identified by LC-MS/MS. Nine polyphenols with gallate group, tetragalloyl glucose, pentagalloyl glucose, eugeniin, 1-desgalloyl eugeniin, casuarinin, castalagin, stenophyllanin C, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, inhibited testosterone metabolism. In particular, pentagalloyl glucose showed the strongest activity. BK and pentagalloyl glucose suppressed testosterone-induced lipogenesis, whereas they weakly inhibited the lipogenic action of insulin. Conclusions. BK inhibited androgen-related pathogenesis of acne, testosterone conversion, and sebum synthesis, partially through 5α-reductase inhibition, and has potential to be a useful agent in the therapeutic strategy of acne.

These antibiotics can be considered pollutants of the environment when they reach water, as well as in cases where they are spread on soils through irrigation or contained in sewage sludge or livestock manure. In this study, batch-type adsorption/desorption experiments were performed for each of the three sulfonamides, adding 7 different concentrations of the antibiotics, going from 1 to 50 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, and with contact time of 24 h. The results indicate that pine bark is the most efficient bioadsorbent among those studied, as it adsorbs up to 95% of the antibiotics added, while desorption is always less than 11%. However, for \"oak ash\" and mussel shell the adsorption is always lower than 45 and 15%, respectively, and desorption is high, reaching up to 49% from \"oak ash\" and up to 81% from mussel shell. Adsorption data showed good fitting to the Linear and Freundlich models, with R<sup>2</sup> values between 0.98 and 1.00 in both cases. K<sub>d</sub> and K<sub>F</sub> adsorption parameters showed similar values for the same sorbent materials but were much higher for pine bark than for the other two bioadsorbents. The Freundlich's n parameter showed values in the range 0.81-1.28. The highest K<sub>F</sub> values (and therefore the highest adsorption capacities) were obtained for the antibiotic SCP in pine bark. Pine bark showed the highest capacity to adsorb each of the antibiotics, increasing as a function of the concentration added. When the concentration of sulfonamide added was 50 μM, the amounts adsorbed were 780 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> for SDZ, 890 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> for SMT, and 870 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> for SCP. \"Oak ash\" and mussel shell have low adsorption capacity for all three sulfonamides, showing values always lower than 150 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> (oak ash) and 20 μmol kg<sup>-1</sup> (mussel shell) when a concentration of 50 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> of antibiotic is added.

Quercus cortex (Oak bark) has been used in European folk medicine since medieval times for treatment of diarrhea, stomatitis, pharyngitis and skin inflammations. Its antimicrobial activity is a well-known therapeutic property of oak bark, and its novel anti-quorum sensing (QS) ability has also been described recently. In this study, we examined the bioactive compounds of Quercus cortex extract and compared their direct antibacterial and regulatory anti-QS effects against Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 in a biotest. Evaluation of the original Quercus cortex extract showed weak antibacterial and prominent anti-QS activities that were retained and completely restored when the samples were dried and re-hydrated. The one-step liquid chromatography result indicated that the anti-QS activity might be determined by hydrophobic compounds; however, the subsequent reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography led to dissipation and loss of the activity. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry gave excellent resolution between a majority of the compounds. Based on this result, 10 of the 35 identified small molecules were selected for further screening. The subsequent investigation indicated several compounds determined both the antibacterial and anti-QS activities of the Quercus cortex extract. Direct antibacterial activity was shown for 1,2,3-benzenetriol and 4-propyl-1,3-benzenediol, while sub-inhibitory concentrations of these compounds led to anti-QS effects.

Symptoms included extensive lengthwise bark cracks, with necrosis of the wood tissue underneath. Isolations were conducted from bark and infected wood after surface sterilization with 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min, followed by five washings in sterilized water. Tissue was placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in petri dishes amended with 0.06 g/l streptomycin at pH 6.5. The dishes were incubated in the dark at 24°C. Colonies reached a diameter of 7 to 8 cm in 7 days. They were whitish grey on the upper surface and blackish at the bottom, and consisted of dense aerial mycelia. The conidia were hyaline, ellipsoid, smooth, non-septate, thin-walled, with their upper end wider than their lower end, and measured 14 to 20 × 4.5 to 7 μm.

Indol-3-ylacetic acid (IAA, auxin) has been characterized by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the cambial region of Abies balsamea, Pinus densiflora, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur. All of the evidence supports the hypothesis that developing leaves and extending shoots are primary sources of IAA. The rate of ethylene emanation varies among conifer species when adjoining phloem and cambial tissues are incubated in vitro. The cambium from young cuttings of Abies balsamea produces more ethylene than that from older cuttings. Ethylene production by seven-year-old Abies balsamea cambium is substantially increased in vitro when the tissue is provided with exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and IAA. In response to elevated ethylene concentrations, cortex growth is accelerated in both hardwood and conifer seedlings. Ethrel (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid) increases ray size and ray-cell number and promotes traumatic resin-canal development in xylem. In Ulmus americana, endogenous ethylene concentrations are inversely correlated with cambial activity. Ethylene decreases vessel diameter in Acer negundo, Acer platanoides and Ulmus americana.

Symptoms causing branch dieback and tree death included a cinnamon-colored gum seeping through multiple 0.95-mm-diameter entry holes on the bole, followed by a prolific, cream-colored foamy liquid. Beneath the outer bark was phloem and xylem necrosis. Fifty 1- to 2.5-mm adult and larval beetles were collected. Adults fit the morphological description of Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis (western oak bark beetle) (R.

All three sequences were identical (GenBank Accession Nos. KJ831289 to 91) and a BLAST search confirmed the closest match (94%) as P. pubipennis. Necrotic wood tissues collected from two trees in each county were cultured on potato dextrose agar amended with 0.01% tetracycline (PDA-tet), and incubated at 25°C for 1 week. Ochre-colored cultures with plane or radially furrowed velutinous mycelium were consistently produced.

G. pallida was re-isolated from all inoculated plants and identified by colony morphology. P. pubipennis is a native beetle, common as a secondary agent, and previously not associated with disease. However, cryptic species may be common among bark and ambrosia beetles (4). A larger sample (i.e., populations and loci) is needed to determine the precise taxonomic status of P. pubipennis. G. pallida was shown to inhibit root growth of Q. petraea by 25% in Europe (1), appears to have affinities with a range of subcorticolous insects, and is widely distributed (5), but there is no published record of the fungus occurring in the United States.

The objective of this study was to screen extracts of twenty Eastern European medicinal plants, using wild-type and reporter Chromobacterium violaceum bioassays, for novel components that target bacterial cells and their quorum sensing (QS) communication systems. Three types of activity and their combinations were revealed: (i) direct antimicrobial growth-inhibitory activity, (ii) non-specific and specific pro-QS activities, (iii) anti-QS activity. Among seven plant extracts showing direct growth-inhibitory activity, the strongest effect was shown by Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry) leaves. Many plants stimulated violacein production by wild-type C. violaceum ATCC 31532 in a non-specific manner, and only the herb Bidens tripartita (three-lobe beggarticks) contained compounds that mimic acyl-homoserine lactone and operated as a QS agonist. Anti-QS activity was found in eleven plants including Quercus robur (oak) cortex, Betula verrucosa (birch) buds and Eucalyptus viminalis (Manna Gum) leaves. Subsequent statistical analysis showed differences between antimicrobial and anti-QS activities, whereas both activities were defined by phylogenetic position of medical resource plant. Finally, extract from Quercus robur cortex revealed at least two fractions, showing different anti-QS mechanisms. These data confirm that multicomponent anti-infectious mechanisms are used by plants, which may be useful for drug development."}

Coumarins are class of natural aromatic compounds based on benzopyrones (2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones). They are identified as secondary metabolites in about 150 different plant species. The ability of coumarins to inhibit cell-to-cell communication in bacterial communities (quorum sensing; QS) has been previously described. Coumarin and its derivatives in plant extracts are often found together with other small molecules that show anti-QS properties too. The aim of this study was to find the most effective combinations of coumarins and small plant-derived molecules identified in various plants extracts that inhibit QS in <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> ATCC 31532 violacein production bioassay. The coumarin and its derivatives: 7-hydroxycoumarin, 7.8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, were included in the study.

The spatial heterogeneity of water uptake by fine roots under field conditions was analyzed in situ with miniature sap flow gauges in a mature beech-oak-spruce mixed stand. Sap flow rate (J), sap flow density (Jd), and root surface-area-specific flow rate (uptake rate, Js) were measured for eight to 10 small-diameter roots (3-4 mm) per species in the organic layer (superficial roots) and in the mineral soil (30-80 cm, deep roots) during four months in summer 1999. We calculated Js by relating J to the surface area of the section of the fine root system distal to the position of the gauge on the root. When measured synchronously, roots of the three species did not differ significantly in mean Js, although oak roots tended to have lower rates. However, Jd decreased in the sequence spruce > beech > oak in most measurement periods. Microscopic investigation revealed differences in fine root anatomy that may partly explain the species differences in Jd and Js. Oak fine roots had a thicker periderm than beech and spruce roots of similar diameter and spruce roots had fewer fine branch rootlets than the other species. Synchronously recorded Jd and Js of nearby roots of the same tree species showed large differences in flow with coefficients of variation from 25 to 150% that could not be explained by patchy distribution of soil water. We hypothesize that the main cause of the large spatial heterogeneity in root water uptake is associated with differences between individual roots in morphology and ultrastructure of the root cortex that affect root radial and root-soil interface conductivities. The high intraspecific variation in Js may mask species differences in root water uptake. Superficial roots of all species typically had about five times higher Jd than deep roots of the same species. However, Js values were similar for superficial and deep roots in beech and spruce because small diameter roots of both species were more branched in the organic layer than in mineral soil. In oak, deep roots had lower Js (maximum of 100 g m(-2) day(-1)) than superficial roots (about 1000 g m(-2) day(-1)). We conclude that temperate tree species in mixed stands have different water uptake capacities. Water flow in the rhizosphere of forests appears to be a highly heterogeneous process that is influenced by both tree species and differences in uptake rates of individual roots within a species."}

A conifer species (Japanese red pine) and a broad-leaved species (Japanese konara oak) were selected to determine whether the radiocesium contamination pattern differs between species. Stem disks were collected at several heights and separated into outer bark, inner bark, and wood. The radiocesium concentration was the highest in the outer bark, followed by that in the inner bark and wood. The vertical distribution of the radiocesium concentration at each stem part differed between the species. The difference between species in radiocesium concentration of the outer bark could be explained by presence or absence of leaves at the time of the disaster. However, the reasons for the differences between species in the radiocesium concentration of the inner bark and wood are unclear. The radial distribution in the wood of the studied species showed a common pattern across stem disk heights and species. However, the radiocesium concentration ratio between sapwood and inner bark was significantly different between species. Although the radial contamination pattern in the wood was similar in the studied species during the early stage of contamination, the radiocesium transport pathway and allocation would be different between the species, and the contamination pattern will likely be different between the species at later stages.

Trees may survive fire through persistence of above or below ground structures.

We investigated bark allocation and carbohydrate investment in eight common oak (Quercus) species of Sky Island mountain ranges in west Texas. We hypothesized that relative investment in bark and carbohydrates changes with tree age and with fire regime: We predicted delayed investment in bark (positive allometry) and early investment in carbohydrates (negative allometry) under lower frequency, high severity fire regimes found in wetter microclimates. Common oaks of the Texas Trans-Pecos region (Quercus emoryi, Q. gambelii, Q. gravesii, Q. grisea, Q. hypoleucoides, Q. muehlenbergii, and Q. pungens) were sampled in three mountain ranges with historically mixed fire regimes: the Chisos Mountains, the Davis Mountains and the Guadalupe Mountains. Bark thickness was measured on individuals representing the full span of sizes found. Carbohydrate concentration in taproots was measured after initial leaf flush. Bark thickness was compared to bole diameter and allometries were analyzed using major axis regression on log-transformed measurements. We found that bark allocation strategies varied among species that can co-occur but have different habitat preferences. Investment patterns in bark were related to soil moisture preference and drought tolerance and, by proxy, to expected fire regime. Dry site species had shallower allometries with allometric coefficients ranging from less than one (negative allometry) to near one (isometric investment). Wet site species, on the other hand, had larger allometric coefficients, indicating delayed investment to defense. Contrary to our expectation, root carbohydrate concentrations were similar across all species and sizes, suggesting that any differences in below ground storage are likely to be in total volume of storage tissue rather than in carbohydrate concentration.

Radiocesium contamination of forests has been a severe problem after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011. Bed logs of Konara oak (Quercus serrata Murray), used for mushroom cultivation, were an economically important product from the forests prior to their contamination. One of the potential countermeasures to reduce radiocesium content in trees is potassium fertilization, but the evidence for the effect of K<sup>+</sup> in reducing Cs<sup>+</sup> uptake has not been obtained yet in the woody plant. Therefore, we investigated the ability of rhizospheric K<sup>+</sup> to suppress uptake and translocation of Cs<sup>+</sup> in Konara oak seedlings through hydroponic experiments in order to clarify the effect of K<sup>+</sup>. Elemental analysis showed that the seedlings cultivated for 4 weeks under low-K (K<sup>+</sup> = 50 μM) contained higher amount of Cs comparing to the seedlings cultivated under high-K (K<sup>+</sup> = 3 mM). Then, the uptake rate of Cs<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in the seedlings from the solution having 50 μM K<sup>+</sup> and 0.1 μM Cs<sup>+</sup> was calculated using radioactive <sup>137</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup> and <sup>42</sup>K<sup>+</sup> to evaluate the effect of growth condition on the ion uptake mechanism. The interference between Cs<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> at the site of root uptake was also evaluated based on the Cs<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> uptake rates at K<sup>+</sup> concentrations of 50 μM, 200 μM, and 3 mM in the seedlings grown under the medium-K (K<sup>+</sup> = 200 μM) condition. As a result, the Cs<sup>+</sup> uptake rate at 50 μM K<sup>+</sup> was not influenced by the growth condition, whereas Cs<sup>+</sup> uptake decreased when the uptake solution itself was supplemented with 3 mM K<sup>+</sup>. In addition, the Cs/K ratio in the seedlings was found to rise to exceed the Cs/K ratio in the culture solution as the rhizospheric K<sup>+</sup> concentration increased, which was in contrast with previous findings in herbaceous plants. Our experiments demonstrated the first direct evidence for woody plants that a high K<sup>+</sup> concentration can suppress Cs accumulation in Konara oak and that it was derived from competition for uptake between K<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> in the rhizosphere, not from the growth K<sup>+</sup> condition."}

Sessile and pedunculate oaks are the most abundant oak species and they exhibit a strong differential tolerance to waterlogging. In order to gain some understanding of the mechanisms of tolerance of both species to hypoxia, we undertook the characterization of the physiological, morphological, cellular and molecular responses of both species to flooding stress. Our results indicate that pedunculate oak, the more tolerant species, succeeded in maintaining its growth, water status and photosynthetic activity at a higher level than sessile oak. Furthermore, pedunculate oak developed aerenchyma in its root cortex as well as adventitious roots. The later exhibited a strong accumulation of class1 non-symbiotic haemoglobin localized by in situ hybridization in the protoderm and in some cortical cells.

In the present study, the amount and direction of gross N retranslocation within a canopy of deciduous oak Quercus serrata Thunb. ex. Murray saplings were investigated. Labeling was conducted with leaves of Q. serrata saplings cultivated under conditions of low-N (LN) or high-N (HN) fertility. Subsequently, N movement within the canopy was traced. Leaves at two different positions in the canopy (top and lateral) were labeled to determine the direction of gross N retranslocation. To detect seasonal differences, the leaf-labeling experiment was conducted twice during the early and late phases of the growing season. In addition, to compare the quantitative importance of gross N retranslocation and root N uptake, the latter was determined by labeling Q. serrata roots. The N-labeling experiment revealed gross N retranslocation among leaves, i.e., from top to lateral, lateral to top and lateral to lateral positions. Gross N retranslocation was quantitatively more important than root uptake, especially for plants cultivated at LN fertility. Season also affected the amount of gross N retranslocation, and these effects differed between LN and HN fertilities. These findings suggest that N allocation within a canopy is controlled dynamically by both gross N output and input. The mechanisms controlling gross N output and input likely function as key determinants of N allocation within a tree canopy."}

In woody plants, oxygen transport and delivery via the xylem sap are well described, but the contribution of bark and woody tissue photosynthesis to oxygen delivery in stems is poorly understood. Here, we combined stem chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with microsensor quantifications of bark O2 levels and oxygen gas exchange measurements of isolated current-year stem tissues of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) to investigate how bark and woody tissue photosynthesis impairs the oxygen status of stems. Measurements were made before bud break, when the axial path of oxygen supply via the xylem sap is impeded. At that time, bark O2 levels showed O2 concentrations below the atmospheric concentration, indicating hypoxic conditions or O2 deficiency within the inner bark, but the values were always far away from anoxic. Under illumination bark and woody tissue photosynthesis rapidly increased internal oxygen concentrations compared with plants in the dark, and thereby counteracted against localised hypoxia. The highest photosynthetic activity and oxygen release rates were found in the outermost cortex tissues. By contrast, rates of woody tissue photosynthesis were considerably lower, due to the high light attenuation of the bark and cortex tissues, as well as resistances in radial oxygen diffusion. Therefore, our results confirm that bark and woody tissue photosynthesis not only play a role in plant carbon economy, but may also be important for preventing low oxygen-limitations of respiration in these dense and metabolically active tissues."}

The antioxidant capacity was determined by the ability to capture OH&bull;, O₂&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup>, ROO&bull;, H₂O₂, NO&bull;, and HClO. The hot water crude extract of <i>Q. crassifolia</i> was chosen to be concentrated and purified due to its higher extraction yield (20.04%), concentration of phenol compounds (747 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g, 25.4 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g, 235 mg ChAE/g, 25.7 mg chlorogenic acid equivalents (ChAE)/g), and antioxidant capacity (expressed as half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>, &micro;g/mL): OH&bull; = 918, O2&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup> = 80.5, ROO&bull; = 577, H₂O₂ = 597, NO&bull; &ge; 4000, HClO = 740). In a second stage, <i>Q. crassifolia</i> extracted with hot water was treated with ethyl acetate, concentrating the phenol compounds (860 mg GAE/g, 43.6 mg QE/g, 362 ChAE/g, 9.4 cyanidin chloride equivalents (CChE)/g) and improving the scavenging capacity (OH&bull; = 467, O2&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup> = 58.1, ROO&bull; = 716, H₂O₂ = 22.0, NO&bull; &ge; 4000, HClO = 108). <i>Q. crassifolia</i> had the highest polyphenolic concentration and the better capacity for scavenging reactive species, being a favorable candidate to be considered in the development of new products."}

About 10% of aphid species show host alternation. These aphids migrate between primary and secondary host plant species in spring and autumn. Host alternation has not been observed in subfamily Lachninae, although it has been suggested on the basis of circumstantial evidence that Stomaphis japonica (Takahashi) may alternate its host between Quercus serrata (Murray) and Quercus acutissima (Carruth). However, a molecular phylogenetic study has indicated that the Stomaphis individuals feeding on these two plant species belong to two different lineages and aphids feeding on Q. acutissima and Pinus densiflora (Sieb. & Zucc.) belong to the same lineage. Here, we examined host alternation in Stomaphis species by comparing molecular phylogenetic identities, morphological features, and life cycles. The molecular analysis and morphological examination showed that aphids feeding on Q. acutissima were the same as those feeding on P. densiflora, whereas aphids feeding on Q. serrata were different from those feeding on Q. acutissima or on P. densiflora. Furthermore, winged aphids were observed on both Q. acutissima and P. densiflora in autumn, but we did not observe winged aphids on Q. serrata. These results indicate that Stomaphis (Walker) individuals feeding on Q. serrata and Q. acutissima belong to two species, one that feeds year-round on Q. serrata, and another, heteroecious species that feeds on P. densiflora as a primary host and on Q. acutissima as a secondary host. This study documents host alternation in subfamily Lachninae for the first time and discusses the acquisition of host alternation by Stomaphis from evolutionary and ecological perspectives."}

We studied competitive adsorption for the tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), and chlortetracycline (CTC) on three bio-adsorbents (mussel shell, oak wood ash, and pine bark). The results were compared for individual systems (with antibiotics added separately) and ternary systems (with all three antibiotics added simultaneously). In all cases batch-type experiments were carried out, with 24 h of contact time. In the individual systems, concentrations of 200 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> were used for each of the three antibiotics, separately. In the ternary system, all three TCs were added simultaneously, using the following total concentrations: 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, each antibiotic being 1/3 of the total. Taking into account that ionic strength of a solution is related to a measure of the concentration of ions in that solution, the use of individual and ternary systems allows to compare, for each antibiotic, systems having equal concentrations and similar ionic strength (concentrations of 200 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>), and systems having different concentrations and ionic strength (200 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> in the individual systems, and 600 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> in the ternary systems, resulting from the sum of 200 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to each of the three antibiotics). Adsorption/desorption results indicated that these processes were in all cases closely related to pH values, and to carbon and non-crystalline minerals contents in the bio-adsorbents. Both oak ash and pine bark adsorbed close to 100% of TCs in individual and ternary systems, with desorption <4% for oak ash, and <12% for pine bark. However, mussel shell gave clearly poorer results, only relatively acceptable for CTC, with adsorption <56% and desorption even >30% for TC and OTC. In view of the results, oak ash and pine bark can be recommended as effective bio-adsorbents for the three TCs studied, and could be useful to retain/inactive them in wastes, and soil or liquid media receiving these emerging pollutants, thus reducing risks of damage for public health and the environment."}

This study was undertaken to quantify the effect of aluminum and calcium on membrane permeability. The influence of Ca(2+) (0.2-3.7 millimolar) and Al(3+) (0-3.7 millimolar) on the permeability of root cortical cells of Quercus rubra was measured using three nonelectrolytes (urea, methyl urea, and ethyl urea) as permeators of progressively increasing lipid solubility. Water permeability was also measured. Al(3+) (a) increased membrane permeability to the nonelectrolytes, (b) decreased the membrane's partiality for lipid permeators, and (c) decreased membrane permeability to water. Ca(2+) had effects on permeability that were opposite to those of Al(3+). When Al(3+) and Ca(2+) were tested in combination, these opposite effects counteracted each other. The results suggest that Al(3+) altered the architecture of membrane lipids."}

We characterized the distribution of nutritional and defensive biochemical traits in galls elicited on chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) by the gall wasp Andricus petiolicolus Basse (Cynipidae) in comparison with gypsy moth-wounded and unwounded leaves. Gall cortex and epidermis exhibited elevated soluble peroxidase (POX) and soluble invertase activities, and greater condensed tannin concentrations than did nutritive tissues or leaves. Nutritive tissue, on which the insect feeds, contained few polyphenols, and lower POX and invertase activities compared with other gall tissues and leaves. Elevated total POX activity arose from a complex pattern of enhanced and suppressed isoform activities in galls. Invertase enzyme activity decreased in all tissues over the course of the 7-d study, although gypsy moth wounding suppressed this decline slightly in ungalled leaves. Our results indicate that the distribution of biochemical defenses in this typical cynipid gall differs significantly from the leaf tissue from which it is formed and support a role for invertases in establishing the gall as a sink. A. petiolicolus larvae do not induce, and may suppress, plant defense responses in nutritive tissue, while enzymatic activity and phenolic accumulation are enhanced in gall tissues surrounding feeding sites. These patterns suggest that the gall is manipulated by the insect to enhance its food and protective value."}
{"pmid":"16510391","text":"Response of sessile oak seedlings (Quercus petraea) to flooding: an integrated study. Sessile oak is a species of great ecological and silvicultural importance in Europe; however, increased frequency and severity of flooding of forested areas pose a threat to its regeneration. We monitored water relations, root anatomical changes and the expression of two calmodulin genes (QpCaM) in sessile oak seedlings during a 14-day flooding treatment. The response followed two characteristic sequences. The first phase, in response to between 1 h and 3 days of flooding, was characterized by a dramatic but transient decline in water relations parameters followed by a recovery towards control values with no noticeable change in root cell morphology. During the second phase, in response to 3 to 14 days of flooding, water relations parameters gradually and continuously declined and hypertrophied lenticels developed at the base of the shoot. Concurrently, root cortical cells became larger and less spherical and the root cortex more porous. These cellular changes were accompanied by a transient rise in root transcript levels of QpCaM-2. We conclude that sessile oak seedlings are capable of withstanding a 3-day period of flooding without significant morphological alterations. In contrast, exposure to flooding for more than 3 days resulted in anatomical and morphological changes in the root system. These changes are, however, insufficient to provide sessile oak with long-term tolerance to flooding."}

To elucidate the relationships between spatiotemporal changes in leaf nitrogen (N) content and canopy dynamics, changes in leaf N and distribution in the canopy of a 26-year-old deciduous oak (Quercus serrata Thunb. ex. Murray) stand were monitored throughout the developmental sequence from leaf expansion to senescence, by estimating the leaf mass and N concentrations of all the canopy layers. Seasonal changes were observed in leaf N concentration per unit leaf dry mass (N (m)), which peaked after bud burst, declined for two weeks shortly thereafter, and then remained constant for the rest of the growing season for each canopy layer. Leaf N concentration per unit leaf area (N (a)) was higher in the upper layer than in the lower layer throughout the growing season, and was closely correlated with relative irradiance (RI) in the summer when the air temperature was moderately high. The N concentrations of all leaf layers started to decrease in November, and reached their lowest values in late November, whereas LMA scarcely changed throughout the season. The lowest N concentrations did not differ significantly among the canopy layers. Seasonal changes in the relationship between N (a) and RI were detected, indicating that N (a) is optimized temporally as well as spatially. Nitrogen resorption efficiency was highest in the upper canopy layers where larger amounts of N were invested. Based on the estimates of leaf mass and leaf N concentrations of the canopy layers, total leaf N concentration of the whole canopy was estimated to be 84.1 kg ha(-1) in the summer, and 37.3 kg ha(-1) in late November. Therefore, 46.8 kg ha(-1) of leaf N in the canopy (about 56% of the total N) was resorbed just before leaf abscission."}

Early season leaf growth requires a large amount of nitrogen, and the amount of N provided for new leaf development has been well tested. Although shoot position within the crown strongly influences leaf properties, little is known about absorbed and remobilized nitrogen allocation in the tree crown. Thus, we investigated differences in the allocation of recently absorbed nitrogen in the tree crown. To quantify nitrogen allocation, we conducted 15N tracer experiments using potted saplings of the temperate deciduous oak (Quercus serrata Thunb. ex. Murray). Allocation of 15N within the crown varied significantly: the top leaves received more remobilized nitrogen than did the lateral leaves, suggesting that remobilized nitrogen is predominantly allocated to the top shoots, which are important for height growth. On the other hand, the proportion of currently-absorbed nitrogen to total nitrogen in the lateral leaves was more than twice that in the top leaves. We also detected the input and the output of nitrogen in the top leaves after the completion of leaf expansion, indicating that significant nitrogen cycling occurs even after full leaf expansion."}

In this study, an acquired pigmentation in Nero Siciliano pigs is reported and evaluated by a multidisciplinary approach to support the hypothesis it is caused by an ingested material. A total of 18 pigs were studied. Fourteen conventionally slaughtered animals showed black discoloration of lymph nodes. The lymph nodes were normal in size and shape but showed diffuse black discoloration of the cortex and medulla. Melanosis of fat was observed in 2 animals and was limited to the back. Histochemical tests performed on tissues enabled identification and differentiation of the pigment. Immunohistochemical staining for macrophage markers showed macrophages containing a variable amount of melanin-like granules. Stains for human melanoma, as well as S-100 protein, did not show any reaction. Histochemical methods for tyrosinase showed colorimetric patterns that confirmed the presence of the enzyme in acorns. The activity was mostly latent. A high tannin content was demonstrated, reaching about 76% of the total phenolic compounds. Our data, and the well-known steps on melanin formation, permit us to hypothesize that swine tyrosinase could act on phenolic substances found in acorns. Tyrosinase activation could take place in genetically predisposed swine after acorns are eaten, and this event could increase the biosynthesis and the anomalous storage of melanin."}

Because Scots pine is well studied and considered a useful bioindicator, we have used this species as a base for comparison of the accumulation ability of sessile oak that shows some features of good bioindicator, but whose biogeochemistry was scarcely studied. Results showed that for both species leaves contained more macroelements (Ca, K, Mg), whereas the bark was richer in most trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Pb). However, trees studied differed with respect to element content. Oak bark and leaves were more effective in accumulating macro- and trace elements (bark Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and leaves Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Ni) than Scots pine tissues. Nevertheless, foliar metal accumulation index of these species was similar, suggesting that their overall ability to accumulate trace metals was similar."}

Taking into account the high mobility and environmental risks due to sulfonamide antibiotics as emerging pollutants, batch-type experiments were performed to study adsorption/desorption of three sulfonamides (sulfadiazine -SDZ-, sulfamethazine -SMT- and sulfachloropyridazine -SCP-) in three agricultural soils. The study was carried out both for un-amended and amended soil samples, using different doses (0, 12, 24 and 48 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) of three different by-products (mussel shell, oak ash and pine bark). Adsorption on un-amended soils was rather low, with percentages between 11 and 45% for SDZ, 20-64% for SMT, and 19-65% for SCP. Both the Linear and Freundlich models fitted well to adsorption curves. In the case of un-amended soils, and regarding the Linear model, the values of the coefficient of distribution (K<sub>d</sub>, expressed in L kg<sup>-1</sup>) were between 0.6 and 1.3 for SDZ, between 0.7 and 1.1 for SMT, and between 0.6 and 2.6 for SCP. As regards the Freundlich model, the values of the adsorption constant (K<sub>F</sub>, expressed in L<sup>1/n</sup> μmol<sup>1-1/n</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>), were in the range 0.4-1.9 for SDZ, 0.9-2.9 for SMT, and 1.2-3.8 for SCP. Simultaneously, desorption percentages were high, reaching 13.7-47.7% for SDZ, 12.6-35.1% for SMT, and 13.7-34.3% for SCP, when the highest initial antibiotic concentration (50 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>) was added, thus indicating low retention and high mobility for these compounds in soils. Mussel shell and oak ash amendments did not increase retention of any of the three sulfonamides. However, the incorporation of pine bark resulted in an increase in the adsorption and decrease in desorption for all three antibiotics. Specifically, for soils amended with pine bark at 48 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, K<sub>d</sub> values (expressed in L kg<sup>-1</sup>) were between 2.1 and 2.9 for SDZ, between 3.4 and 3.6 for SMT, and between 2.5 and 8.2 for SCP. Regarding K<sub>F</sub> (expressed in L<sup>1/n</sup> μmol<sup>1-1/n</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>), its values ranged from 5.6 to 6.3 for SDZ, 6.2-8.8 for SMT, and 5.3-7.1 for SCP. These scores were clearly higher than those of un-amended soils, and pine bark amendment also resulted in lower desorption percentages, ranging 8.7-11.4% for SDZ, 4.0-10.7% for SMT, and 6.5-16.9% for SCP. This positive effect on the retention of sulfonamides due to pine bark can be attributed to its high organic carbon content (48.6%), as well as to its acidic pH<sub>w</sub> (4.0). Therefore, pine bark amendment can be considered an effective alternative to increase the retention of sulfonamides in soils, thus reducing their bioavailability and transport to other environmental compartments, and subsequent risks of negative impacts on human and environmental health."}

The bark of Prunus jamasakura Siebold (Pruni Cortex) has long been used in Japan as a folk remedy and is one of ingredients of the Kampo formula, Jumi-haidoku-to (JHT). JHT is used for treatment of skin diseases such as acne (acne vulgaris). According to Kampo medicinal sources, Quercus Cortex can be used in place of Pruni Cortex. In this study, we found that water extracts of Pruni Cortex, not Quercus Cortex showed a binding effect on estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta). Thus, their chemical analysis was carried out by GC-MS and found that five unique constituents (i.e., sakuranetin, naringenin, genistein, genkwanin and arctigenin) were detected in Pruni Cortex. The ERbeta binding capacity of these constituents was examined using 70 ng/ml 17beta-estradiol, as the positive control with 100% ERbeta binding. Among them, genistein (60% at 10 ng/ml) showed the strongest binding capacity than naringenin (60% at 1000 ng/ml) and sakuranetin (40% at 1000 ng/ml). These results suggested that Pruni Cortex in JHT could play an important role in treatment of acne. In addition, those of Pruni Cortex from different harvest places were also examined in their chemical contents and ERbeta binding capacity. The extracts of Pruni Cortex from Kyushu in Japan and Anhui Province in China showed higher contents of genistein and stronger ERbeta binding capacity than that of Pruni Cortex from Tokushima Prefecture in Japan."}

Oak wood is used in barrels for wine aging. During aging, polyphenols are transferred from the barrels to the liquid. Although the bioactivity of oak polyphenols in wines has been extensively studied, no investigation exists on their toxicological properties, which limits their use as functional safe ingredients for other products. In this work, the chemical composition of a polyphenolic extract of Quercus crassifolia bark (QCBe) was studied by GC-MS. Its antibacterial properties on probiotic and pathogenic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity were determined as a way to understand the potential impact from its addition to fermented food as a functional ingredient. QCBe shows a selective inhibition of Escherichia coli compared with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus. According to the toxicity evaluation, the subacute no-observed-adverse-effect-level was achieved at 11 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the subacute lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level for kidney damage was at 33 mg/kg bw/day. These results suggest that, given the fact an adverse effect was observed after subacute administration of this extract, further longer term toxicological studies are needed to provide sufficient safety evidence for its use in humans. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Mexico's yogurt market is growing which creates opportunities for the development of some yogurt products as functional foods. As a first step to evaluate its potential use in yogurt formulation, the antibacterial effect of a Quercus crassifolia polyphenolic extract (QCBe) on probiotic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity in rats were studied. A low inhibition on probiotic bacteria growth was observed after QCBe addition to Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus cultures. Exposure to QCBe for a subacute duration resulted in renal injury in rats at dosages greater than or equal to 33 mg/kg/bw/day. This adverse effect indicates the importance of performing further long-term toxicological assessments prior to the addition of QCBe to a food like yogurt, which is regularly eaten by consumers."}
