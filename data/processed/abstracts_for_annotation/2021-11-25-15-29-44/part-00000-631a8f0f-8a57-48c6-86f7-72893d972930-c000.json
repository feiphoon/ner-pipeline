Medicinal plants and herbal extracts from traditional Chinese medicine are used increasingly commonly worldwide for their benefits to health and quality of life as dietary supplements or as ingredients in functional foods. Among them, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (a natural strong remedy for the treatment of a variety of conditions) is traditionally used for centuries in Asian countries as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory agent. In this context, several evidences support the hypothesis that some tanshinones (in particular tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone) extracted from the roots (Danshen) of Salvia miltiorrhiza exert neuroprotective and analgesic activities. Oxaliplatin (OXA), a platinum-based drug used for the treatment of solid tumors, induces neuropathic pain which hampers the chemotherapy success. While several attempts were made to prevent oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy, a growing number of evidences look to natural sources as an effective remedy to counterbalance the OXA-mediated side effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pain-relieving profile of Danshen and its active constituents tanshinone IIA (TIIA) and cryptotanshinone (CRY) in animal models of neuropathic pain induced by OXA, anticancer drug characterized by a dose-limiting neurotoxicity. Contextually, the neuroprotective and anticancer activities of the selected compounds were tested in different cells lines. A single administration per os of CRY (30 mg mg/kg) significantly, in a dose dependent manner, attenuated chemotherapy-induced pain. A 7 days repeated administrations highlighted the effectiveness and potency of both CRY and TIIA (10 mg/kg). On the other hand, Danshen showed a painkiller profile against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Contextually, Danshen and its active constituents showed remarkable and selective inhibitory activities on glioblastoma cells lines LN-229 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 50.0 ± 4.0, 48.2 ± 4.9 and 51.9 ± 2.3 μM respectively for Danshen standardized extract, TIIA and CRY) next to healthy but high proliferative cell lines enterocytes (IC<sub>50</sub>:> 250 μM for TIIA and CRY) and keratinocytes (IC<sub>50</sub>: >100 and 97 ± 2 μM respectively for TIIA and CRY). Taken together the results reported here demonstrated the long-lasting pain-relieving effects of Danshen and its related bioactive constituents in animal models of neuropathic pain and their selective in vitro neuroprotective properties on certain central malignancy cells lines. Thus, suggest that S. miltiorrhiza roots could be considered as a new potential source of active diterpenoidic compounds useful for pharmaceutical or nutraceutical industries and beneficial as food complements."}

WD40 proteins play crucial roles in response to abiotic stress. By screening the genome sequences of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, 225 SmWD40 genes were identified and divided into 9 subfamilies (I-IX). Physiological, biochemical, gene structure, conserved protein motif and GO annotation analyses were performed on SmWD40 family members. The SmWD40-170 was found in 110 SmWD40 genes that contain drought response elements, SmWD40-170 was one of these genes whose response in terms of expression under drought was significant. The expression of SmWD40-170 was also up-regulated by ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Through observed the stomatal phenotype of SmWD40-170 transgenic lines, the stomatal closure was abolished under dehydration, ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in SmWD40-170 knockdown lines. Abscisic acid (ABA), as the key phytohormone, elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels under drought stress. The ABA-ROS interaction mediated the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the activation of anion channel in guard cells. The osmolality alteration of guard cells further accelerated the stomatal closure. As a second messenger, nitric oxide (NO) regulated ABA signaling, the NO stimulated protein kinase activity inhibited the K<sup>+</sup> influx which result in stomatal closure. These NO-relevant events were essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. The reduction of NO production was also observed in the guard cells of SmWD40-170 knockdown lines. The abolished of stomatal closure attributed to the SmWD40-170 deficiency induced the reduction of NO content. In general, the SmWD40-170 is a critical drought response gene in SmWD40 gene family and regulates ABA- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal movement by affecting the synthesis of NO."}

Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) is a valuable medicinal herb with two kinds of clinically used natural products, salvianolic acids and tanshinones. miR396 is a conserved microRNA and plays extensive roles in plants. However, it is still unclear how miR396 works in S. miltiorrhiza. In this study, an smi-MIR396b has been cloned from S. miltiorrhiza. Overexpression of miR396b in danshen hairy roots inhibited hairy root growth, reduced salvianolic acid concentration, but enhanced tanshinone accumulation, resulting in the biomass and total salvianolic acids respectively reduced to 55.5 and 72.1% of the control and total tanshinones increased up to 1.91-fold of the control. Applied degradome sequencing, 5'RLM-RACE, and qRT-PCR, 13 targets for miR396b were identified including seven conserved SmGRF1-7 and six novel ones. Comparative transcriptomics and microRNomics analysis together with qRT-PCR results confirmed that miR396b targets SmGRFs, SmHDT1, and SmMYB37/4 to mediate the phytohormone, especially gibberellin signaling pathways and consequentially resulted in the phenotype variation of miR396b-OE hairy roots. Furthermore, miR396b could be activated by methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, gibberellin, salt, and drought stresses.

Here, an endophytic fungus Mucor circinelloides DF20 was co-cultivated with the sterile seedlings of S. miltiorrhiza, to clarify the promoting mechanism on tanshinone biosynthesis and accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza root. The assay of promoting-growth activities in vitro showed that DF20 have the ability to produce IAA and siderophores. DF20 could significantly promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of tanshinones in the root of S. miltiorrhiza, especially the content of tanshinone ⅡA, reaching 4.630 ± 0.342 mg/g after 56 days of DF20 treatment, which is 22-fold of the control group. The result also showed that the hyphae of M. circunelloides DF20 mainly colonized in the root tissue interspace of S. miltiorrhiza, and a small amount of hyphae were located inside the cells. The results of florescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that DF20 colonization significantly increase the expression level of some key enzyme genes (DXS, DXR, HMGR, GGPPS) in tanshinone biosynthesis pathway, but the regulatory effect mainly occurred in the early stage of co-culture, while the expression level decreased in different degrees in the later stage.

Multivariate analysis was conducted to screen differential metabolites. Analysis indicated distinct differences between sweated and non-sweated samples. 10,108 substance peaks had been detected altogether, and 4759 metabolites had been identified from negative and positive ion model. 287 differential metabolites were screened including 112 up-regulated and 175 down-regulated and they belong to lipids and lipid-like molecules, and phenylpropanoid and polyketides. KEGG analysis showed the pathway of linoleic acid metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were mainly enriched. 31 and 49 identified metabolites were exclusively detected in SSM and NSSM, respectively, which mainly belong to carboxylic acids and derivatives, polyketides and fatty acyls.
