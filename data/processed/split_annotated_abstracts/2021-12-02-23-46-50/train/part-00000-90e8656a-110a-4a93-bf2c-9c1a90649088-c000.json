Urb. has been used as an herbal brain tonic for mental disorders and enhancing memory, but no review of the overall evidence of C. asiatica and cognitive function has been conducted. This study aims to determine the effects of C. asiatica on cognitive function and its related properties. The current systematic review includes five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica alone and six RCTs conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica-containing products. Meta-analysis indicated that there are no significant differences in all cognitive function domains of C. asiatica when compared to placebo. However, it could improve mood by increasing alert scores [SMD: 0.71 (95% CI; 0.01 to 1.41); I2 = 30.5%] and decreasing anger scores at 1 hour after treatment [SMD: -0.81 (95%CI; -1.51 to -0.09); I2 = 36.6%]. None of the studies reported adverse effects of C. asiatica. In conclusion, there is not strong evidence to support the use of C. asiatica for cognitive function improvement in each cognitive domain. C. asiatica could improve alertness and relieve anger. However, some limitations should be aware including dose regimen, plant preparation, standardization, and product variation. Future well-designed clinical trials using suitable doses of standardized C. asiatica are still needed.","id":3,"label":[["11","38","scientific"],["127","154","scientific"]],"pmid":"28878245"}

{"data":"Oral administration of Centella asiatica (L.) Urb leave aqueous extract ameliorates cerebral oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in male rats with type-2 diabetes. Centella asiatica is claimed to have a neuroprotective effect; however, its ability to protect the cerebrum against damage in diabetes has never been identified. The aims were to identify the possibility that C. asiatica ameliorates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the cerebrum in diabetes. C. asiatica leave aqueous extract (C. asiatica) (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/b.w.) were given to diabetic rats for 28 days. Changes in rats' body weight, food and water intakes, and insulin and FBG levels were monitored. Following sacrificed, cerebrum was harvested and subjected for histological, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. The results revealed treatment with C. asiatica was able to ameliorate the loss in body weight, the increase in food and water intakes, the decrease in insulin, and the increase in FBG levels in diabetic rats. Additionally, histopathological changes in the cerebrum and levels of p38, ERK, JNK, cytosolic Nrf2, Keap-1, LPO, RAGE, and AGE levels decreased; however, PI3K, AKT, IR, IRS, GLUT-1, nuclear Nrf2, Nqo-1, Ho-1, and anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) levels increased in diabetic rats receiving C. asiatica. Furthermore, C. asiatica treatment also caused cerebral inflammation and apoptosis to decrease as indicated by decreased inflammatory markers (cytosolic NF-κB p65, p-Ikkβ, Ikkβ, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), decreased pro-apoptosis markers (Casp-3, 9, and Bax), but increased anti-apoptosis marker, Bcl-2. Activity level of Na+/K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+-ATPases in the cerebrum also increased by C. asiatica treatment. Conclusions: C. asiatica treatment helps to prevent cerebral damage and maintain near normal cerebral function in diabetes.","id":6,"label":[["23","49","scientific"],["174","191","common"]],"pmid":"32588370"}
{"data":"Effects of methyl jasmonate on the growth and triterpenoid production of diploid and tetraploid Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. hairy root cultures. In this study, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the phytomass and triterpenoid production of diploid and tetraploid Centella asiatica hairy roots were investigated. Hairy root cultures were obtained from diploid and induced tetraploid plants of C. asiatica infected by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain ATCC 43057. MeJA triggered triterpenoid production in both ploidy hairy roots, whereas triterpenoids were not produced in the untreated hairy roots. Among the treatments, the 50 µM MeJA treatment yielded the maximum triterpenoid production in diploid hairy roots of 27.25 ± 0.27 µg/mg Dry weight (DW) total triterpenoid at day 21. For the tetraploid hairy root cultures, the 28th-day hairy root culture produced a maximum amount of triterpenoids of 16.29 ± 6.32 µg/mg DW in response to the 50 µM MeJA treatment, whereas the 100 µM MeJA treatment produced a similar triterpenoid amount (16.31 ± 9.24 µg/mg DW) at day 14. Moreover, in response to 50 µM MeJA, we obtained different ratios of aglycone to glycoside, i.e., 1:7 and 1:2, between the diploid and tetraploid hairy root cultures. Asiaticoside was the dominant phytochemical, followed by asiatic acid and madecassic acid.

{"data":"Hypericum perforatum L. prevents the acquisition of and promotes resilience against stress-induced reinstatement of the conditioned place preference induced by cocaine. Cocaine use disorder is a serious problem worldwide, and there are no approved medications for its treatment. A novel approach to the treatment of drug addiction is the use of natural products, and, in this context, preclinical evidence suggests that Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericum) is effective against alcohol and other substance use disorders. We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300 mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. All the mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg) and, after extinction of CPP, the reinstating effects of social defeat (alone or with 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg of Hypericum) were evaluated. All the doses of Hypericum prevented the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. Furthermore, the plant extract dose-dependently reduced the reinstating effects of social defeat. Therefore, Hypericum is effective in reducing the rewarding effects of cocaine and prevents the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in mice. The mechanisms underlying these positive effects of Hypericum perforatum L. need to be determined by future research. Our results endorse Hypericum as a natural treatment for cocaine dependence.","id":8,"label":[["420","443","scientific"],["0","23","scientific"],["1638","1661","scientific"]],"pmid":"34371124"}

{"data":"Characterization of pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and their outcomes: A claims data analysis. Little is known about the utilization of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) during pregnancy. In Germany, certain preparations of St. John's wort can be reimbursed by statutory health insurances, facilitating to investigate exposure to St. John's wort based on claims data. We therefore aimed to characterize pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and to explore potential malformations in the babies. Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester. There was a dispensation of other antidepressants before pregnancy in 21 % (during pregnancy: 12 %). Eleven percent of pregnancies ended in non-live births. In 312 babies linked to 305 pregnancies, major malformations were coded in 18 babies (5.8 %), of which 17 were exposed in the first trimester. The crude relative risk of major malformations for babies exposed during the first vs. the second or third trimester only was 3.56 (0.48-26.17). Our results suggest that only in a minority of pregnancies, St. John's wort is used as an alternative to other antidepressants. Even though the relatively high rates of non-live births and major malformations after exposure to St. John's wort during the first trimester need to be interpreted with caution, the findings are striking and generate hypotheses that merit further investigation.","id":10,"label":[["161","184","scientific"],["144","159","common"],["43","58","common"],["621","636","common"],["1706","1721","common"],["1873","1888","common"],["1109","1124","common"],["442","457","common"],["240","255","common"],["346","361","common"]],"pmid":"33961968"}
{"data":"Impact of potential stimulants on asiaticoside and madecassoside levels and expression of triterpenoid-related genes in axenic shoot cultures of Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. The triterpenoid saponins, asiaticoside and madecassoside from Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. are known to have a wide range of applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The effect of addition of Potential Metabolite Stimulants (PMSs) - casein acid hydrolysate, meat peptone, salicylic acid, copper sulphate, and silver nitrate, on the concentrations of these saponins and transcript levels of associated genes encoding important biosynthetic enzymes, was assessed in axenic shoot cultures of C. asiatica. Among the stimulants, silver nitrate induced asiaticoside content approximately 6-fold increase in madecassoside levels, after three weeks post-treatment with a decrease in biomass compared to its control. Gene expression analysis of essential genes involved in triterpenoid synthesis such as β-amyrin synthase showed an upregulation of approximately 50-fold at the third week of silver nitrate treatment compared to control. These findings suggest that silver nitrate can act as a metabolite stimulant, to enhance the formation of triterpenoids in axenic shoot culture of C. asiatica, which could be utilized in studying the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis and biotechnological application for the increased production of these bioactive molecules.","id":11,"label":[["145","171","scientific"],["236","263","scientific"]],"pmid":"33839454"}

However, improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However, silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus, plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy.
