{"data":"The Biochemical and Genetic Basis for the Biosynthesis of Bioactive Compounds in <i>Hypericum Perforatum</i> L., One of the Largest Medicinal Crops in Europe. <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. commonly known as Saint John's Wort (SJW), is an important medicinal plant that has been used for more than 2000 years. Although <i>H. perforatum</i> produces several bioactive compounds, its importance is mainly linked to two molecules highly relevant for the pharmaceutical industry: the prenylated phloroglucinol hyperforin and the naphtodianthrone hypericin. The first functions as a natural antidepressant while the second is regarded as a powerful anticancer drug and as a useful compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While the antidepressant activity of SJW extracts motivate a multi-billion dollar industry around the world, the scientific interest centers around the biosynthetic pathways of hyperforin and hypericin and their medical applications. Here, we focus on what is known about these processes and evaluate the possibilities of combining state of the art omics, genome editing, and synthetic biology to unlock applications that would be of great value for the pharmaceutical and medical industries.","id":24,"label":[["159","189","scientific"],["81","111","scientific"],["208","225","common"]],"pmid":"33081197"}
{"data":"Improvements in estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia by Hypericum perforatum L. extract are associated with gut microbiota and related metabolites in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Hypericum perforatum L. (HP), a well-known natural medicine, has a potential effect on menopausal hypercholesterolemia. However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia. The underlying mechanism may be associated with improvements in gut microbiota composition and the profile of related metabolites as well as increases in bile acid secretion.","id":25,"label":[["68","91","scientific"],["189","212","scientific"]],"pmid":"33383372"}

{"data":"Oral administration of Centella asiatica (L.) Urb leave aqueous extract ameliorates cerebral oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in male rats with type-2 diabetes. Centella asiatica is claimed to have a neuroprotective effect; however, its ability to protect the cerebrum against damage in diabetes has never been identified. The aims were to identify the possibility that C. asiatica ameliorates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the cerebrum in diabetes. C. asiatica leave aqueous extract (C. asiatica) (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/b.w.) were given to diabetic rats for 28 days. Changes in rats' body weight, food and water intakes, and insulin and FBG levels were monitored. Following sacrificed, cerebrum was harvested and subjected for histological, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. The results revealed treatment with C. asiatica was able to ameliorate the loss in body weight, the increase in food and water intakes, the decrease in insulin, and the increase in FBG levels in diabetic rats. Additionally, histopathological changes in the cerebrum and levels of p38, ERK, JNK, cytosolic Nrf2, Keap-1, LPO, RAGE, and AGE levels decreased; however, PI3K, AKT, IR, IRS, GLUT-1, nuclear Nrf<sub>2,</sub> Nqo-1, Ho-1, and anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) levels increased in diabetic rats receiving C. asiatica. Furthermore, C. asiatica treatment also caused cerebral inflammation and apoptosis to decrease as indicated by decreased inflammatory markers (cytosolic NF-κB p65, p-Ikkβ, Ikkβ, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), decreased pro-apoptosis markers (Casp-3, 9, and Bax), but increased anti-apoptosis marker, Bcl-2. Activity level of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases in the cerebrum also increased by C. asiatica treatment.

While <i>C. asiatica</i> showed relevant effects as traditional medicine, the mechanism of <i>C. asiatica</i> suppressing inflammation has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of methanol fraction from <i>C. asiatica</i> (MCA) at the molecular level in murine macrophages. Levels of inflammation-related mediators were observed with treatment of MCA. MCA significantly suppressed nitric oxide production and iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> production was alleviated by MCA via the downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2. MCA treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text] and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. LPS/D-GalN-induced acute hepatitis in mouse was alleviated by MCA treatment. In addition, MCA decreased the phosphorylation of inhibitory [Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] (I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text]) at Ser32/36 and thereby blocked I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] degradation.

{"data":"Induction of root colonization by Piriformospora indica leads to enhanced asiaticoside production in Centella asiatica. Centella asiatica (Indian pennywort) has wide application in Indian and Chinese traditional medicines with documented evidence for wound healing and neuroprotective and anti-aging potential. Asiaticoside, a trisaccharide triterpene, is the most medicinally active compound in the plant. β-Amyrin synthase and squalene synthase have been identified as the two key genes in the triterpenoid pathway which regulate the production of asiaticoside in C. asiatica. The paper reports salient findings of our study utilizing the growth-promoting endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica to successfully colonize roots of C. asiatica in vitro cultures for investigating the effect of the mutualistic association on asiaticoside production. Co-cultivation of P. indica resulted in the rapid enhancement of root and shoot biomass of host plant, which was visible after 7 days of culture and continued up to 45 days. P. indica co-cultivation also favored the synthesis of asiaticosides, as evidenced by HPLC analysis which indicated about twofold increase (0.53% (w/w) in leaves and 0.23% (w/w) in whole plant) over control (0.33% (w/w) in leaves and 0.14% (w/w) in whole plant). Real-time PCR results confirmed the strong upregulation of squalene synthase and β-amyrin synthase transcripts in P. indica-challenged plants compared with the control. Our data demonstrate the potential use of P. indica as a means to enhance plant secondary metabolite production in planta with scope for further field evaluation.","id":31,"label":[["101","118","scientific"],["120","137","scientific"],["139","155","common"]],"pmid":"21688071"}
{"data":"Characterization of pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and their outcomes: A claims data analysis. Little is known about the utilization of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) during pregnancy. In Germany, certain preparations of St. John's wort can be reimbursed by statutory health insurances, facilitating to investigate exposure to St. John's wort based on claims data. We therefore aimed to characterize pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and to explore potential malformations in the babies. Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester. There was a dispensation of other antidepressants before pregnancy in 21 % (during pregnancy: 12 %). Eleven percent of pregnancies ended in non-live births. In 312 babies linked to 305 pregnancies, major malformations were coded in 18 babies (5.8 %), of which 17 were exposed in the first trimester. The crude relative risk of major malformations for babies exposed during the first vs. the second or third trimester only was 3.56 (0.48-26.17). Our results suggest that only in a minority of pregnancies, St. John's wort is used as an alternative to other antidepressants. Even though the relatively high rates of non-live births and major malformations after exposure to St. John's wort during the first trimester need to be interpreted with caution, the findings are striking and generate hypotheses that merit further investigation.","id":32,"label":[["43","58","common"],["144","159","common"],["240","255","common"],["346","361","common"],["442","457","common"],["621","636","common"],["1109","1124","common"],["1706","1721","common"],["1873","1888","common"],["161","184","scientific"]],"pmid":"33961968"}

In this study, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the phytomass and triterpenoid production of diploid and tetraploid Centella asiatica hairy roots were investigated. Hairy root cultures were obtained from diploid and induced tetraploid plants of C. asiatica infected by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain ATCC 43057. MeJA triggered triterpenoid production in both ploidy hairy roots, whereas triterpenoids were not produced in the untreated hairy roots. Among the treatments, the 50 µM MeJA treatment yielded the maximum triterpenoid production in diploid hairy roots of 27.25 ± 0.27 µg/mg Dry weight (DW) total triterpenoid at day 21. For the tetraploid hairy root cultures, the 28th-day hairy root culture produced a maximum amount of triterpenoids of 16.29 ± 6.32 µg/mg DW in response to the 50 µM MeJA treatment, whereas the 100 µM MeJA treatment produced a similar triterpenoid amount (16.31 ± 9.24 µg/mg DW) at day 14.
