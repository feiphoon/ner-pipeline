{"data":"Acylated oleanane-type triterpene saponins from the flowers of Bellis perennis show anti-proliferative activities against human digestive tract carcinoma cell lines. Seven oleanane-type triterpene saponin bisdesmosides, perennisaponins N-T (1-7), were newly isolated from a methanol extract of daisy, the flowers of Bellis perennis L. (Asteraceae). The structures were determined based on chemical and physicochemical data and confirmed using previously isolated related compounds as references. The isolates, including 13 previously reported perennisaponins A-M (8-20), exhibited anti-proliferative activities against human digestive tract carcinoma HSC-2, HSC-4, and MKN-45 cells. Among them, perennisaponin O (2, IC50 = 11.2, 14.3, and 6.9 μM, respectively) showed relatively strong activities. The mechanism of action of 2 against HSC-2 was found to involve apoptotic cell death.

{"data":"Insulin Mimetic Properties of Extracts Prepared from <i>Bellis perennis</i>. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and consequential cardiovascular diseases lead to millions of deaths worldwide each year; 90% of all people suffering from DM are classified as Type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. T2DM is linked to insulin resistance and a loss of insulin sensitivity. It leads to a reduced uptake of glucose mediated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle and adipose tissue, and finally hyperglycemia. Using a fluorescence microscopy-based screening assay we searched for herbal extracts that induce GLUT4 translocation in the absence of insulin, and confirmed their activity in chick embryos. We found that extracts prepared from <i>Bellis perennis</i> (common daisy) are efficient inducers of GLUT4 translocation in the applied in vitro cell system. In addition, these extracts also led to reduced blood glucose levels in chicken embryos (in ovo), confirming their activity in a living organism. Using high-performance liquid chromtaography (HPLC) analysis, we identified and quantified numerous polyphenolic compounds including apigenin glycosides, quercitrin and chlorogenic acid, which potentially contribute to the induction of GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, <i>Bellis perennis</i> extracts reduce blood glucose levels and are therefore suitable candidates for application in food supplements for the prevention and accompanying therapy of T2DM.","id":"565d24e0-0f9d-4e5a-87dc-0757ba93434b","label":[["56","71","common"],["714","729","common"],["735","747","common"],["1253","1268","common"]],"pmid":"30314325"}
