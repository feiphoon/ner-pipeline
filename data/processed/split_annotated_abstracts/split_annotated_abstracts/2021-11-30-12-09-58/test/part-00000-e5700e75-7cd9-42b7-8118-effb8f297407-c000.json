{"data":"DNA Authentication of St John's Wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L.) Commercial Products Targeting the ITS Region. There is considerable potential for the use of DNA barcoding methods to authenticate raw medicinal plant materials, but their application to testing commercial products has been controversial. A simple PCR test targeting species-specific sequences within the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was adapted to screen commercial products for the presence of <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. material. DNA differing widely in amount and extent of fragmentation was detected in a number of product types. Two assays were designed to further analyse this DNA using a curated database of selected <i>Hypericum</i> ITS sequences: A qPCR assay based on a species-specific primer pair spanning the ITS1 and ITS2 regions, using synthetic DNA reference standards for DNA quantitation and a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay separately targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions. The ability of the assays to detect <i>H. perforatum</i> DNA sequences in processed medicines was investigated. Out of twenty different matrices tested, both assays detected <i>H. perforatum</i> DNA in five samples with more than 10³ ITS copies µL<sup>-1</sup> DNA extract, whilst the qPCR assay was also able to detect lower levels of DNA in two further samples. The NGS assay confirmed that <i>H. perforatum</i> was the major species in all five positive samples, though trace contaminants were also detected.","id":260,"label":[["38","68","scientific"],["22","36","common"]],"pmid":"30970623"}
{"data":"Effects of Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. on cognitive function and mood related outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. has been used as an herbal brain tonic for mental disorders and enhancing memory, but no review of the overall evidence of C. asiatica and cognitive function has been conducted. This study aims to determine the effects of C. asiatica on cognitive function and its related properties. The current systematic review includes five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica alone and six RCTs conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica-containing products. Meta-analysis indicated that there are no significant differences in all cognitive function domains of C. asiatica when compared to placebo. However, it could improve mood by increasing alert scores [SMD: 0.71 (95% CI; 0.01 to 1.41); I<sup>2</sup> = 30.5%] and decreasing anger scores at 1 hour after treatment [SMD: -0.81 (95%CI; -1.51 to -0.09); I<sup>2</sup> = 36.6%]. None of the studies reported adverse effects of C. asiatica. In conclusion, there is not strong evidence to support the use of C. asiatica for cognitive function improvement in each cognitive domain. C. asiatica could improve alertness and relieve anger. However, some limitations should be aware including dose regimen, plant preparation, standardization, and product variation. Future well-designed clinical trials using suitable doses of standardized C. asiatica are still needed.","id":254,"label":[["11","38","scientific"],["127","154","scientific"]],"pmid":"28878245"}
{"data":"Efficacy and Safety of <i>Centella Asiatica</i> (<i>L.</i>) Urb. on Wrinkles: A Systematic Review of Published Data and Network Meta-Analysis. <i>Centella asiatica</i> has many applications in cosmetics, including wrinkle treatments, but its effectiveness remains to be clarified. This systematic review study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of <i>C. asiatica</i> for reducing facial wrinkles. PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thai Library Integrated System, and Thai university database/journals were searched until May 2019. Five double-blinded randomised controlled trials, including 172 Asian females, were included. Endpoints were wrinkling measured by visual score, image analysis, and participant satisfaction. Two placebo-controlled studies applied gel/creams containing <i>C</i>. <i>asiatica</i> or asiaticoside for 12 w to periorbital skin. Two studies applied tretinoin or <i>Pueraria mirifica</i> contralaterally and by network meta-analysis <i>C</i>. <i>asiatica</i> appeared more effective than <i>P. mirifica</i> but possibly less than tretinoin. Asiaticoside applied as a lipstick for 8 w reduced lip wrinkling. Skin hydration was markedly raised by <i>C. asiatica</i> but not tretinoin. One study reported 10 adverse events for <i>C. asiatica</i> and 35 for tretinoin. Cochrane risk of bias was generally low, reporting was weak, and lack of <i>C. asiatica</i> standardization prevents general application. From the reported data, it is possible to conclude that <i>C. asiatica</i> improved lip and periocular wrinkles, and may replace retinoids if its long-term safety is established and <i>C. asiatica</i> is standardized.","id":235,"label":[["23","64","scientific"],["143","167","common"]],"pmid":"33413787"}

Urb or Indian pennywort is a plant of ethnopharmacological relevance, commonly called as Brahmi in South India known for its antimicrobial property in gut and for the treatment of other gut ailments. Natural anti-virulence drugs that disarm pathogens by directly targeting virulence factors or the cell viability and are thus preferred over antibiotics as these drugs impose limited selection pressure for resistance development. In this regard, an in-vitro experimental study was conducted to know the effect of extract of Centella asiatica(L.)

{"data":"Trace Element Uptake and Accumulation in the Medicinal Herb Hypericum perforatum L. Across Different Geolithological Settings. The worldwide growing interest in traditional medicines, including herbal medicines and herbal dietary supplements, has recently been accompanied by concerns on quality and safety of this type of health care. The content of nutritional and potentially toxic elements in medicinal plants is of paramount interest as it may vary remarkably according to different environmental and ecophysiological factors. In this study, the concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements-Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sr, and Zn-were determined in the roots and aerial parts of the worldwide distributed and economically important medicinal herb Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort) and in its growing substrate. Most of the analyzed trace elements varied considerably in the plant parts according to edaphic conditions and soil geochemistry. However, uptake and retention in H. perforatum compartments of Co, Cr, and Ni, which markedly differentiated the investigated soils, were controlled by excluding mechanisms of the plant. Despite this, the Ni concentrations in the aerial parts, commonly used in herbal preparations, of H. perforatum plants from serpentine soils were not insignificant in relation to eventual human consumption. Good practice to assure the herbal product quality of H. perforatum collected from the wild cannot ignore the thorough understanding of the geolithological and geochemical features of the harvesting areas.","id":246,"label":[["60","83","scientific"],["756","779","scientific"],["781","796","common"]],"pmid":"30043286"}
