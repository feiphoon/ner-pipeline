{"data":"Characterization of pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and their outcomes: A claims data analysis. Little is known about the utilization of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) during pregnancy. In Germany, certain preparations of St. John's wort can be reimbursed by statutory health insurances, facilitating to investigate exposure to St. John's wort based on claims data. We therefore aimed to characterize pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort and to explore potential malformations in the babies. Using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), pregnancies exposed to St. John's wort during at least one trimester between 2006 and 2016 and the corresponding babies were identified. Exposure was identified via outpatient dispensations. Pregnancies were characterized regarding timing of exposure, use of other antidepressants, pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of major malformations in the babies (not considering codes for musculoskeletal and other malformations due to low data quality in this regard). Out of 496 pregnancies with a dispensation of St. John's wort during pregnancy, 420 (85 %) had a dispensation during the first trimester. There was a dispensation of other antidepressants before pregnancy in 21 % (during pregnancy: 12 %). Eleven percent of pregnancies ended in non-live births. In 312 babies linked to 305 pregnancies, major malformations were coded in 18 babies (5.8 %), of which 17 were exposed in the first trimester. The crude relative risk of major malformations for babies exposed during the first vs. the second or third trimester only was 3.56 (0.48-26.17). Our results suggest that only in a minority of pregnancies, St. John's wort is used as an alternative to other antidepressants. Even though the relatively high rates of non-live births and major malformations after exposure to St. John's wort during the first trimester need to be interpreted with caution, the findings are striking and generate hypotheses that merit further investigation.","id":277,"label":[["43","58","common"],["144","159","common"],["240","255","common"],["346","361","common"],["442","457","common"],["621","636","common"],["1109","1124","common"],["1706","1721","common"],["1873","1888","common"],["161","184","scientific"]],"pmid":"33961968"}

Hypericin is a molecule of high pharmaceutical importance that is synthesized and stored in dark glands (DGs) of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Understanding which genes are involved in dark gland development and hypericin biosynthesis is important for the development of new Hypericum extracts that are highly demanded for medical applications. We identified two transcription factors whose expression is strictly synchronized with the differentiation of DGs. We correlated the content of hypericin, pseudohypericin, endocrocin, skyrin glycosides and several flavonoids with gene expression and DG development to obtain a revised model for hypericin biosynthesis. Here, we report for the first time genotypes which are polymorphic for the presence/total absence (G+/G-) of DGs in their placental tissues (PTs). DG development was characterized in PTs using several microscopy techniques. Fourier transform infrared microscopy was established as a novel method to precisely locate polyaromatic compounds, such as hypericin, in plant tissues. In addition, we obtained transcriptome and metabolome profiles of unprecedented resolution in Hypericum.

{"data":"Hypericum perforatum L. prevents the acquisition of and promotes resilience against stress-induced reinstatement of the conditioned place preference induced by cocaine. Cocaine use disorder is a serious problem worldwide, and there are no approved medications for its treatment. A novel approach to the treatment of drug addiction is the use of natural products, and, in this context, preclinical evidence suggests that Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericum) is effective against alcohol and other substance use disorders. We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300 mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300 mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. All the mice were conditioned with cocaine (25 mg/kg) and, after extinction of CPP, the reinstating effects of social defeat (alone or with 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg of Hypericum) were evaluated. All the doses of Hypericum prevented the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. Furthermore, the plant extract dose-dependently reduced the reinstating effects of social defeat. Therefore, Hypericum is effective in reducing the rewarding effects of cocaine and prevents the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in mice. The mechanisms underlying these positive effects of Hypericum perforatum L. need to be determined by future research.

{"data":"Improvements in estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia by Hypericum perforatum L. extract are associated with gut microbiota and related metabolites in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Hypericum perforatum L. (HP), a well-known natural medicine, has a potential effect on menopausal hypercholesterolemia. However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia. The underlying mechanism may be associated with improvements in gut microbiota composition and the profile of related metabolites as well as increases in bile acid secretion.","id":220,"label":[["68","91","scientific"],["189","212","scientific"]],"pmid":"33383372"}

The efficacy of Centella asiatica is comprehensive and is used as an anti‑inflammatory agent, for memory improvement, for its antitumor activity and for treatment of gastric ulcers. The present study investigated the protective effects of Centella asiatica on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)‑induced liver injury in rats. The rats in the treatment groups were treated with Centella asiatica at either 100 or 200 mg/kg in distilled water (D.W) or with silymarin (200 mg/kg in D.W) by oral administration for 5 days daily following intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg DMN. Centella asiatica significantly decreased the relative liver weights in the DMN‑induced liver injury group, compared with the control. The assessment of liver histology showed that Centella asiatica significantly alleviated mass periportal ± bridging necrosis, intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis, with fibrosis of liver tissues. Additionally, Centella asiatica significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde, significantly increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and may have provided protection against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Centella asiatica significantly decreased inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑10, IL‑12, tumor necrosis factor‑α, interferon‑γ and granulocyte/macrophage colony‑stimulating factor.

{"data":"Straightforward Preparation of Naphtodianthrone-Rich Ethanolic Extracts from Wild St. John's Wort. Separation of naphtodianthrones (NTs) from Hypericum perforatum L. (aerial part of St. John's Wort) is still topical due to some hard-to-beat medicinal attributes of these bioactive compounds. Unfortunately, their low bioavailability (0.06%-0.4%) complicates the extraction process. Therefore, developing straightforward and lower-cost methodologies for NT separation is still a priority. In support of this purpose, for preparing NT formulations from flowers and leaves of wild St. John's Wort (hyperici herba), a cutoff preparative methodology is described herein. Combining Soxhlet extraction and reflux extraction, some concentrated and rather pure NT ethanolic-based formulations without chlorophyl and grease were obtained.","id":231,"label":[["182","197","common"],["142","165","scientific"],["82","97","common"],["578","593","common"],["595","609","pharmaceutical"]],"pmid":"30380351"}
{"data":"The Biochemical and Genetic Basis for the Biosynthesis of Bioactive Compounds in <i>Hypericum Perforatum</i> L., One of the Largest Medicinal Crops in Europe. <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. commonly known as Saint John's Wort (SJW), is an important medicinal plant that has been used for more than 2000 years. Although <i>H. perforatum</i> produces several bioactive compounds, its importance is mainly linked to two molecules highly relevant for the pharmaceutical industry: the prenylated phloroglucinol hyperforin and the naphtodianthrone hypericin. The first functions as a natural antidepressant while the second is regarded as a powerful anticancer drug and as a useful compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While the antidepressant activity of SJW extracts motivate a multi-billion dollar industry around the world, the scientific interest centers around the biosynthetic pathways of hyperforin and hypericin and their medical applications. Here, we focus on what is known about these processes and evaluate the possibilities of combining state of the art omics, genome editing, and synthetic biology to unlock applications that would be of great value for the pharmaceutical and medical industries.","id":263,"label":[["159","189","scientific"],["81","111","scientific"],["208","225","common"]],"pmid":"33081197"}

{"data":"Transgenic expression of Hyp-1 gene from Hypericum perforatum L. alters expression of defense-related genes and modulates recalcitrance to Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1) isolated from Hypericum perforatum L. was characterized as a defense gene involved in H. perforatum recalcitrance to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation Hypericum perforatum L. is a reservoir of high-value secondary metabolites of increasing interest to researchers and to the pharmaceutical industry. However, improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However, silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus, plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy. Overall, our findings suggest Hyp-1 modulates recalcitrance to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum.","id":208,"label":[["41","64","scientific"],["224","247","scientific"],["377","400","scientific"]],"pmid":"31776675"}
