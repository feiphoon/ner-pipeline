Centella\u00a0asiatica\u00a0(L.) Urban, known in the United States as Gotu kola, is widely used as a traditional herbal medicine in Chinese or Indian Pennywort. The efficacy of Centella\u00a0asiatica is comprehensive and is used as an anti\u2011inflammatory agent, for memory improvement, for its antitumor activity and for treatment of gastric ulcers. The present study investigated the protective effects of Centella\u00a0asiatica on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)\u2011induced liver injury in rats. The rats in the treatment groups were treated with Centella\u00a0asiatica at either 100 or 200\u00a0mg/kg in distilled water (D.W) or with silymarin (200\u00a0mg/kg in D.W) by oral administration for 5\u00a0days daily following intraperitoneal injections of 30\u00a0mg/kg DMN. Centella\u00a0asiatica significantly decreased the relative liver weights in the DMN\u2011induced liver injury group, compared with the control. The assessment of liver histology showed that Centella\u00a0asiatica significantly alleviated mass periportal\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0bridging necrosis, intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis, with fibrosis of liver tissues. Additionally, Centella\u00a0asiatica significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde, significantly increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and may have provided protection against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. In addition, Centella\u00a0asiatica significantly decreased inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2, IL\u20112, IL\u20116, IL\u201110, IL\u201112, tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, interferon\u2011\u03b3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony\u2011stimulating factor. These results suggested that Centella\u00a0asiatica had hepatoprotective effects through increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the levels of inflammatory mediators in rats with DMN\u2011induced liver injury. Therefore, Centella\u00a0asiatica may be useful in preventing liver damage.", "date_completed": "20170417", "date_revised": "20181113"}
