It showed a typical circular structure composed of 151,782\u2009bp in length and comprised of a large single-copy region (82,903bp) and a small single-copy region (17,667\u2009bp) which were separated by two inverted repeat regions (25,606\u2009bp). From the phylogenetic analyses of related taxa using the complete chloroplast genome sequences, it was proved that <i>T. quinquecostatus</i> var. <i>japonicus</i> is sister to the member of genus <i>Mentha</i> within the subfamily Nepetoideae.", "date_revised": "20210210"}
