In this study, a rapid and sensitive ultraperformance convergence chromatography method was firstly established for quantification of thymol and carvacrol, two positional isomers of a major bioactive in the volatile oil of <i>Thymi herba</i>, the dried leaves and flowers of <i>Thymus mongolicus</i> or <i>Thymus przewalskii</i>, known in China as \"Dijiao.\" Using a Trefoil<sup>TM</sup> CEL1 column, thymol and carvacrol were separated in less than 2.5 min and resolution was enhanced. The method was validated with respect to precision, accuracy, and linearity according to the National Medical Products Administration guidelines. The optimized method exhibited good linear correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.9998-0.9999), excellent precision (relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 1.50%), and acceptable recoveries (87.29-102.89%). The limits of detection for thymol and carvacrol were 1.31 and 1.57 ng/L, respectively, while their corresponding limits of quantification were 2.63 and 3.14 ng/L. Finally, the quantities of the two compounds present in 16 <i>T. mongolicus</i> and four <i>T. przewalskii</i> samples were successfully evaluated by employing the developed method. It is hoped that the results of this study will serve as a guideline for the quality control of <i>Thymi herba</i>.", "date_completed": "20201127", "date_revised": "20201127"}
