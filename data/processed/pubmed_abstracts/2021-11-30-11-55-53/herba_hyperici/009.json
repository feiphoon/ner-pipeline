The samples examined were as follows: chamomile (Flos Chamomillae), peppermint (Folium Menthae piperitae), lemon balm (Folium Melissae), St. John's wort (Herba Hyperici), and two herbal mixtures. The fungal composition depended on the specified sample. Xerophilic fungi, i.e. Eurotium amstelodami, E. herbariorum, E. rubrum and Wallemia sebi were isolated from dried medicinal plants. E. amstelodami was the predominating species. The prevailing thermophilic and thermotolerant species were Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis and Aspergillus fumigatus. Pink and white yeasts were also numerous in some samples. Except for Aspergillus niger, mesophilic and toxigenous species were found to occur infrequently in the samples. However, Aspergillus versicolor was found to occur abundantly in lemon balm.", "date_completed": "20060808", "date_revised": "20061115"}
