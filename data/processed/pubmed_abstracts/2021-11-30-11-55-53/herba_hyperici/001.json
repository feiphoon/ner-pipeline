{"pmid": "1608041", "doi": [], "language": ["jpn"], "title": "[Effects of various methanol extracts of crude drugs on experimental subacute and chronic hepatic injury].", "abstract": "The effects of 5 crude drugs (Myricae Cortex, Polygoni Avicularis Herba, Hyperici Erecti Herba, Forsythiae Fructus, Desmodii Herba) on subacute and chronic hepatic injuries induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) were investigated in rats. All of these crude drugs suppressed significantly the increase of several biochemical parameters with CCl4-injection twice per week for 4 weeks. Polygoni Avicularis Herba and Desmodii Herba among 5 crude drugs also protected the subacute hepatic injury induced by ANIT-injection for 4 weeks. In addition, the therapeutic effect of Desmodii Herba on the chronic hepatic injury induced by CCl4-injection for 9 weeks was recognized. Desmodii Herba has protective effects on the acute and subacute hepatic injuries induced by CCl4 or ANIT and an improving effect on the chronic injury induced by CCl4. Though the increase of hydroxylproline content in the liver began 4 weeks after the CCl4 or ANIT treatment, every crude drug had no significant effect against the liver fibrosis in these study.", "date_completed": "19920722", "date_revised": "20190724"}
