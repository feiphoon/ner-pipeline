(thyme) extracts aid murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) to fight Streptococcus mutans during in vitro infection.", "abstract": "Finding an effective alternative way to aid defense cells to fight Streptococcus mutans was the main goal of this study. The effect of plant extracts from Curcuma longa L. (turmeric), Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary), and Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme) was evaluated on murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) infected by S. mutans. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was determined. Macrophages were infected by S. mutans and treated with each extract. From the supernatants, it was measured nitric oxide (NO) level. Posteriorly, RAW 264.7 were lysed to expose living and phagocytosed bacteria. Cytotoxicity was checked by lysosomal activity analysis, using neutral red assay. Each extract helped RAW 264.7 to eliminate S. mutans during infection, as observed by a significant bacterial reduction. Significant cell viability was also found. Besides, an increased production of NO was verified using R. officinalis L. and T. vulgaris L. extracts. The evaluated extracts demonstrated an effective action to assist RAW 264.7 to fight S. mutans during infection.", "date_completed": "20201019", "date_revised": "20201019"}
