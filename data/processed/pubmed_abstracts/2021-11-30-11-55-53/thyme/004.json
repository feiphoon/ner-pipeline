Compounds in Vapor Phase.", "abstract": "The aim of this work was to evaluate the antifungal activity in vapor phase of thymol, p-cymene, and \u03b3-terpinene, the red thyme essential oil compounds (RTOCs). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of RTOCs was determined against postharvest spoilage fungi of the genera <i>Botrytis</i>, <i>Penicillium</i>, <i>Alternaria</i>, and <i>Monilinia</i>, by measuring the reduction of the fungal biomass after exposure for 72 h at 25 \u00b0C. Thymol showed the lowest MIC (7.0 \u00b5g/L), followed by \u03b3-terpinene (28.4 \u00b5g/L) and p-cymene (40.0 \u00b5g/L). In the case of <i>P. digitatum</i> ITEM 9569, resistant to commercial RTO, a better evaluation of interactions among RTOCs was performed using the checkerboard assay and the calculation of the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI). During incubation, changes in the RTOCs concentration were measured by GC-MS analysis. A synergistic effect between thymol (0.013 \u00b1 0.003 L/L) and \u03b3-terpinene (0.990 \u00b1 0.030 L/L) (FICI = 0.50) in binary combinations, and between p-cymene (0.700 \u00b1 0.010 L/L) and \u03b3-terpinene (0.290 \u00b1 0.010 L/L) in presence of thymol (0.008 \u00b1 0.001 L/L) (FICI = 0.19), in ternary combinations was found. The synergistic effect against the strain <i>P. digitatum</i> ITEM 9569 suggests that different combinations among RTOCs could be defined to control fungal strains causing different food spoilage phenomena.", "date_completed": "20210325", "date_revised": "20210325"}
