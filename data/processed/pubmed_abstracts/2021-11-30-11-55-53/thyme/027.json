RTO vapours significantly reduced (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) the percentage of infected wounds, the external growth area and the production of spores in inoculated orange fruit stored for 12\u00a0days at 7\u00a0\u00b0C in a polypropylene film selected for its appropriate permeability. Among the RTO compounds, p-cymene and thymol were the most abundant in packed boxes at the end of cold storage. The RTO vapours did not affect the main quality parameters of the oranges, or the taste and odour of the juice. The results have shown that an active packaging, using RTO vapours, could be employed, by the citrus industry, to extend the shelf-life of oranges for fresh market use and juice processing.", "date_completed": "20201116", "date_revised": "20201116"}
