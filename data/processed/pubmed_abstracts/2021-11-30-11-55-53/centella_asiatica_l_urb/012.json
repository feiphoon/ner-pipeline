Urb or Indian pennywort is a plant of ethnopharmacological relevance, commonly called as Brahmi in South India known for its antimicrobial property in gut and for the treatment of other gut ailments. Natural anti-virulence drugs that disarm pathogens by directly targeting virulence factors or the cell viability and are thus preferred over antibiotics as these drugs impose limited selection pressure for resistance development. In this regard, an in-vitro experimental study was conducted to know the effect of extract of Centella asiatica(L.) Urb. on cholera toxin, gene expression and its vibriocidal effect on five standard strains of Vibrio cholerae; IDH03097 (El Tor variant), N16961 (El Tor), O395 (Classical) as well as five clinical strains (Haitian variant).", "date_revised": "20210811"}
