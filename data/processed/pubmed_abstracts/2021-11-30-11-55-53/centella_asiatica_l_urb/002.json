Urb (APIACEAE).", "abstract": "The simultaneous quantification of madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid and asiatic acid in Centella asiatica by HPLC-UV is proposed. Asiaticoside was used as reference for the quantification of heterosides and asiatic acid for aglycones. The evaluation of the extraction efficiency of the four molecules led to use Soxhlet extraction for 8 h. The method was validated and was found to be accurate in the concentration range of 1.0-3.0 mg/ml for asiaticoside and 0.5-2.0 mg/ml for asiatic acid with CV <3% for all investigated compounds. LOD and LOQ were, respectively, 0.0113 and 1.0 mg/ml for asiaticoside and 0.0023 and 0.5 mg/ml for asiatic acid. This method was shown to be convenient for routine analysis of samples of C. asiatica.", "date_completed": "20090924", "date_revised": "20191210"}
