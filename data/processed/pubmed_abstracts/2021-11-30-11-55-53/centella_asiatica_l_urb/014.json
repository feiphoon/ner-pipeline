Urb. leaves have been previously reported to exhibit antioxidant activity. The objective of the present study is to determine the in vitro antioxidant activity of the combined extracts of M. oleifera and C. asiatica (TGT-PRIMAAGE) and its effect on hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)-induced oxidative stress in human dermal fibroblasts. TGTPRIMAAGE acted on the mechanism of hydrogen transfer as it showed scavenging activity in the DPPH assay. This is due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids in TGT-PRIMAAGE. TGT-PRIMAAGE effectively reduced cellular generation of reactive oxygen species induced by H O2. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were also increased in cells treated with TGT-PRIMAAGE. 2 Treatment with TGT-PRIMAAGE showed significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the number of senescent cells. Significant reduction (P < 0.05) of malondialdehyde was also seen in cells treated with TGT-PRIMAAGE. The p53 protein level was reduced in TGT-PRIMAAGEtreated cells, which indicates its potential in protecting the cells from oxidative stress induced by H2O2.", "date_revised": "20201001"}
