The aqueous extract (50 g/L) was obtained by infusion followed by cold maceration for 24 h. The levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were 2.86 g/100 g and 0.361 g/100 g, respectively. The AE showed elevated DPPH scavenging activity, with an IC(50) value of 31.25 microg/mL. The AE had a promising activity against mouse melanoma (B(16)F(1)), human breast cancer (MDA MB-231) and rat glioma (C(6)) cell lines, with IC(50) values of 698.0, 648.0 and 1000.0 microg/mL, respectively. A positive correlation was established between the level of flavonoids, antioxidant and antitumor activities.", "date_completed": "20140715", "date_revised": "20211020"}
