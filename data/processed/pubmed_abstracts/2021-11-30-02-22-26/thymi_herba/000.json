Bromhexin increased this transport rate 1.34 fold and KNEIPP-Hustentee 1.38 fold. The components of the cough tea had different effects on the mucociliar activity. The following ingredients increased the transport rate with falling rank order: Folia farfarae (coltsfoot), fructus foeniculi (fennel), and fructus anisi (anise). Herba plantaginis (plantain), flores verbasci (torch weed), and radix liquiritiae (liquorice) were ineffective whereas semen foenigraeci (foenugrec), radix althaeae (marsh mallow), and herba thymi (mother of thyme) had an inhibiting effect in raising rank order. The latter two groups of ingredients are constituents of the tea because of their attributed additional effects, e.g. protective effects due to mucous layers in the hypopharynx and spasmolytic, secretolytic and bactericide effects.", "date_completed": "19800625", "date_revised": "20061115"}
