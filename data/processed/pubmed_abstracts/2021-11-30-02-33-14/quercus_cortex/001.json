{"pmid": "16193818", "doi": [], "language": ["eng"], "title": "The influence of plant raw materials, containing ellagic acid and selected antibiotics on immunological response in mice.", "abstract": "It is demonstrated that the combined addition to a culture of aqueous extracts from tannin pharmacopoeial raw materials, containing elladic acid (Cortex Quercus, Folium Uvae ursi and Rhizoma Tormentillae) and the antibiotics: cefuroxime, cefoperazone and doxycycline influences the enhancement of survival of mouse thymocytes in cultures with supplementation of hydrocortisone. A cytotoxic test was used for the evaluation. The presented results confirmed that each of the applied aqueous extracts shows a better survival of mouse thymocytes after combined addition of an antibiotic to the culture. The extract from Cortex Quercus showed the highest activation when added to the culture with cefuroxime, whereas cefoperazone best stimulation demonstrated when combined with the extract from Rhizoma Tormentillae, and doxycycline with the extract from Folium Uvae ursi.", "date_completed": "20051014", "date_revised": "20131121"}
