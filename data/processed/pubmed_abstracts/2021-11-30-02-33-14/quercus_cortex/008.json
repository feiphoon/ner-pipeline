As a model species, Quercus spp. were selected. In order to compare the obtained results with previous research, four well-described abandoned Cu-deposits were selected for sampling: \u013dubietov\u00e1 (Slovakia), Libiola and Caporciano (Italy), and\u00a0S\u00e3o Domingos (Portugal). The results of micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirm the irregular contamination of Quercus spp. by potentially toxic elements. The level of contamination is the highest predominantly in the root cortex, where is also the highest Ca contents (with exception of S\u00e3o Domingos). At \u013dubietov\u00e1 and Caporciano, high Ni content was described in branches cortex, in branches mesoderm also Fe, Cu and Zn. At the same time, the inhibition influence of Ca was also confirmed regarding the input of these elements into plants.", "date_completed": "20210810", "date_revised": "20210810"}
