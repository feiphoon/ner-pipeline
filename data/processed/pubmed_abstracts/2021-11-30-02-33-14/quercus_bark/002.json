Of these compounds, glucodistylin exhibited uncompetitive inhibitory activity against recombinant human aldose reductase with an IC(50) value of 7.2 \u03bcM. Furthermore, glucodistylin inhibited sorbitol accumulation by 48.84% at 50 \u03bcM. This flavonoid showed therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of diabetes-related complications.", "date_completed": "20110923", "date_revised": "20181016"}
