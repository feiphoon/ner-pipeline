The structure of compound 1 was determined using multidimensional (1)H and (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopy. The antioxidant properties of compounds 1-12 were investigated using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl radical-scavenging assay with compounds 6-11 displaying significant antioxidant activity (EC50 values of 5.2-23.7 \u03bcM). Our findings suggest the extracts of Q. acutissima Carruth are a potential source of natural antioxidant additives for use in the food and other allied industries.", "date_completed": "20141215", "date_revised": "20140729"}
