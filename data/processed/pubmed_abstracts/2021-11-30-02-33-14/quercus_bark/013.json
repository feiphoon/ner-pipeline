Pharmacodynamics of the new gel was studied by the following methods: antimicrobial effect - by diffusion method in agar gel (compared product - Metrogyl denta\u00ae gel); reparative effect - on the model of linear cut wounds (compared product - Calendula ointment); anti-inflammatory activity - on the model of acute carrageenan-induced inflammation (compared product - Diclofenac natrium gel 5%). It has been established that the antimicrobial activity of the new gel against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Candida albicans NCTC 885-653, Escherichia faecalis ATCC 29212, and Staphylococcus mutans ATCC 35668 is slightly lower in comparison with Metrogyl denta\u00ae gel exhibiting a\u00a0powerful antimicrobial activity. According to the reparative effect on the model of linear cut wounds, the new gel exceeded the effectiveness (by 24%, p &lt; 0.001) of the compared drug based on the medicinal plant material - Calendula ointment. A\u00a0significant anti-inflammatory activity of the new gel has been revealed under the conditions of acute carrageenan inflammation. It exceeded the Diclofenac natrium gel in the first hours of the experiment, indicating an anti-lipoxygenase activity of the new gel. The established antimicrobial, reparative and anti-inflammatory activity of a\u00a0new gel containing aloe vera and oak bark extracts confirmed its potential use in the treatment of destructive inflammatory periodontal diseases.", "date_completed": "20201110", "date_revised": "20201110"}
