They were extracted by ethanol (90%) maceration and hot water. The antioxidant capacity was determined by the ability to capture OH&bull;, O\u2082&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup>, ROO&bull;, H\u2082O\u2082, NO&bull;, and HClO. The hot water crude extract of <i>Q. crassifolia</i> was chosen to be concentrated and purified due to its higher extraction yield (20.04%), concentration of phenol compounds (747 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g, 25.4 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g, 235 mg ChAE/g, 25.7 mg chlorogenic acid equivalents (ChAE)/g), and antioxidant capacity (expressed as half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>, &micro;g/mL): OH&bull; = 918, O2&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup> = 80.5, ROO&bull; = 577, H\u2082O\u2082 = 597, NO&bull; &ge; 4000, HClO = 740). In a second stage, <i>Q. crassifolia</i> extracted with hot water was treated with ethyl acetate, concentrating the phenol compounds (860 mg GAE/g, 43.6 mg QE/g, 362 ChAE/g, 9.4 cyanidin chloride equivalents (CChE)/g) and improving the scavenging capacity (OH&bull; = 467, O2&bull;<sup>&minus;</sup> = 58.1, ROO&bull; = 716, H\u2082O\u2082 = 22.0, NO&bull; &ge; 4000, HClO = 108). <i>Q. crassifolia</i> had the highest polyphenolic concentration and the better capacity for scavenging reactive species, being a favorable candidate to be considered in the development of new products.", "date_revised": "20200929"}
