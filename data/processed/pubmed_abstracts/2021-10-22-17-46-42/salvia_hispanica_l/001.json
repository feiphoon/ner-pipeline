Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) is a revived omega-3 plant source that is richest in ALA level. In this study, based on the RACE method, one full-length cDNA sequence encoding FAD6, named ShFAD6, was isolated from chia. There exist three alternative transcription start sites and five alternative poly(A) tailing sites in ShFAD6. The 5'UTR of ShFAD6 contains a purine-stretch of 44\u00a0bp. ShFAD6 has an ORF of 1335\u00a0bp encoding a 444 aa protein of 51.33\u00a0kDa. ShFAD6 contains a conserved Delta12-FADS-like domain together with three strong trans-membrane helices and three histidine motifs. There also exists a chloroplast transmit peptide in ShFAD6 N-terminal. Phylogenetic analyses validated its identity of dicot FAD6 protein and suggested some critical evolutionary features of plant FAD6 genes. Heterologous yeast expression confirmed the catalytic activity of ShFAD6. The qRT-PCR assay showed that ShFAD6 is mainly expressed in leaves, stems, flowers, buds and early-stage seeds, and also responded to various stresses and hormone treatments. Under Sclerotinia infection, qRT-PCR and fluorescence imaging illustrated the possible correlation of ShFAD6 expression and photosynthesis. This study provides insight for further function study of ShFAD6 in oil quality improvement in staple oilseed crops as well as stress response and adaptation in plants.", "article_date": "20210401", "date_completed": "20210928", "date_revised": "20210928"}
