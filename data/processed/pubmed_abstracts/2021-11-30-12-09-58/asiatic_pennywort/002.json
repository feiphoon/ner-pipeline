The structure of isomadecassoside was established by means of HR-ESIMS and detailed analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra, which allowed a complete NMR assignment. Studies on isolated J774A.1 macrophages stimulated by LPS revealed that isomadecassoside (<b>4</b>) inhibited nitrite production at non-cytotoxic concentrations, thus indicating an anti-inflammatory effect similar to that of madecassoside.", "date_completed": "20210916", "date_revised": "20210916"}
