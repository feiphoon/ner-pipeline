Pennell in the phytoremediation of sewage (greywater).", "abstract": "The freely and abundantly available amphibious plant Indian pennywort Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennell was able to phytoremediate sewage (greywater) quickly and substantially in SHEFROL\u00ae (\"sheet flow root level\") bioreactors, achieving reductions in the levels of several indicator parameters: suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, copper, nickel, and manganese to the extents of about 90%, 76-77%, 80%, 65%, 55%, 56%, 42%, and 41%, respectively at hydraulic retention times of just 6\u00a0h. As these indicators of primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments were achieved simultaneously in a single reactor compartment, the system presented in this paper promises to be simple, rapid, and economical, in achieving significant treatment of greywater.", "date_completed": "20200401", "date_revised": "20210110"}
