However, recent investigations highlighted that this species could be advantageous for the cure of other pathological situations, such as trigeminal neuralgia, as well as in the treatment of cancer. This review focuses on the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of St. John's Wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum),</i> its derivatives, and other <i>Hypericum</i> species in hematologic malignancies. <i>Hypericum</i> induces apoptosis in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. Other <i>Hypericum</i> targets include matrix metalloproteinase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which are mediators of cell migration and angiogenesis. <i>Hypericum</i> also downregulates the expression of proteins that are involved in the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, <i>Hypericum</i> and its derivatives appear to have photodynamic effects and are candidates for applications in tumor photodynamic therapy. Although the in vitro studies appear promising, controlled in vivo studies are necessary before we can hypothesize the introduction of <i>Hypericum</i> and its derivatives into clinical practice for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.", "date_completed": "20210401", "date_revised": "20210401"}
