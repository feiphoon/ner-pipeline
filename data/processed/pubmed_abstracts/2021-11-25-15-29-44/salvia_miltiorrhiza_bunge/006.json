Many studies reported that the active component tanshinones displayed a variety of biological activities: anti-thrombous, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor promoting. But the mechanism of how the active components working still need to be clarified. The anti-tumor effect of compounds of tanshinone (CTN), the methanol extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge roots, was investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CTN on the growth inhibition, apoptosis and molecular targets of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).", "date_completed": "20170719", "date_revised": "20191210"}
