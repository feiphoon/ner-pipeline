Tanshinones and phenolic acids are the major secondary metabolites and significant pharmacological constituents of this plant. Kelch repeat F-box (KFB) proteins play important roles in plant secondary metabolism, but their regulation mechanism in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> has not been characterized. In this study, we systematically characterized the <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> KFB gene family. In total, 31 <i>SmKFB</i> genes were isolated from <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i>. Phylogenetic analysis of those <i>SmKFBs</i> indicated that 31 <i>SmKFBs</i> can be divided into four groups. Thereinto, five <i>SmKFBs</i> (<i>SmKFB1, 2, 3, 5, and 28</i>) shared high homology with other plant KFBs which have been described to be regulators of secondary metabolism. The expression profile of <i>SmKFBs</i> under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment deciphered that six <i>SmKFBs</i> (<i>SmKFB1, 2, 5, 6, 11, and 15</i>) were significantly downregulated, and two <i>SmKFBs</i> (<i>SmKFB22 and 31</i>) were significantly upregulated. Tissue-specific expression analysis found that four <i>SmKFBs</i> (<i>SmKFB4, 11, 16, and 17</i>) were expressed preferentially in aerial tissues, while two <i>SmKFBs</i> (<i>SmKFB5, 25</i>) were predominantly expressed in roots. Through a systematic analysis, we speculated that <i>SmKFB1, 2, and 5</i> are potentially involved in phenolic acids biosynthesis.", "date_completed": "20210316", "date_revised": "20210316"}
