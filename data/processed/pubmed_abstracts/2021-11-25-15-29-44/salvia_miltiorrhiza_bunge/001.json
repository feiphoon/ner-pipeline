The absolute configurations of chiral centers were determined by comparison with reported coupling constants, optical rotation values, and CD techniques. Anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated using nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition assays, and by determining the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Two new caffeic acid derivatives, 8-epiblechnic acid 9-methyl ester (4) and 8-epiblechnic acid 9'-methyl ester (5), and eight known derivatives, caffeic acid methyl ester (1), shimobashiric acid B (2), rosmarinic acid methyl ester (3), salvianolic acid C (6), methyl salvianolate C (7), lithospermic acid monomethyl ester (8), lithospermic acid dimethyl ester (9), and dimethyl lithospermate B (10), were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of S. miltiorrhiza. All caffeic acid derivatives were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on NO production. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited NO production with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.4 and 0.6\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. These compounds also strongly inhibited the production of iNOS and COX-2. In addition, compound 3 induced the expression HO-1 in a concentration-dependent manner at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM.", "date_completed": "20180820", "date_revised": "20180820"}
