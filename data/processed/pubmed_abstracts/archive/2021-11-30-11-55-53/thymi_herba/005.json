Therefore, two feeding trials were performed with piglet groups ranging from 17 to 22 animals each. Either 10 g of Thymi herba/kg feed (Thymi herba group), 10 mg flavophospholipol/kg feed (flavophospholipol group) or nothing (control group) was added to the animals' feed. No significant differences in the performance parameter daily weight gain among any groups were recorded. No differences concerning feed efficiency or isolation of haemolytic E. coli serotypes were shown. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Thymi herba against 39 haemolytic E. coli isolates from the same weaners was investigated in vitro by disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration and bactericidal concentration testing. In contrast to the feeding results, the essential oil of the thyme batch fed showed antibacterial activity against all haemolytic E. coli investigated. This interesting antibacterial potential of Thymi herba prompts further investigations as to its value as feed additive.", "date_completed": "20060227", "date_revised": "20051201"}
