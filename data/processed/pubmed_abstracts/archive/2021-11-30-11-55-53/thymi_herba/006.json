Available in Pharmacies in Poland: Short Communication.", "abstract": "Scientific reports about elemental impurities in final pharmaceutical products are essential from a regulatory point of view; unfortunately, there is a lack of studies about this important toxicological topic. The aim of our short communication was determination of total Cr impurities in traditional herbal medicinal products (THMP) with Thymi herba (Thymus vulgaris L. and Thymus zygis L.) available in Polish pharmacies (n\u2009=\u20096, because only six manufacturers produce this kind of pharmaceutical products in Poland). The total content of Cr impurities was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using electrothermal atomization (ETAAS). Applied comprehensive toxicological risk assessment was based on three main tiers: Tier 1, the comparison of raw results as total Cr impurities profile (metal per L of THMP) with ICH Q3D guideline standards; Tier 2, the estimation of total Cr exposure with a single dose; and Tier 3, the estimation of total Cr daily exposure. We confirmed that total Cr impurities were present in all analyzed THMP with thymi herba (the observed level was below 6.0\u00a0\u00b5g/L). Total Cr concentration in a single dose can be deceptively high in comparison to the raw results but is not a threat to patients (20.15-63.45\u00a0ng/single dose). Moreover, the estimation of total Cr daily exposure shows that all analyzed THMP are characterized by daily dose (40.30-181.41\u00a0ng/day) below PDE value (10,700\u00a0mg/day); hence, all products meet the standards of ICH Q3D elemental impurities guideline.", "date_revised": "20210810"}
