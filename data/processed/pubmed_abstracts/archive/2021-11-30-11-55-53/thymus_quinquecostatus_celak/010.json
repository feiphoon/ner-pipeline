The antioxidant activities were compared with other natural and synthetic antioxidants. The levels of total polyphenols and flavonoids were also determined. The extracts were found to have different levels of antioxidant properties in a few kind of assay. The results showed that higher radical scavenging activity, reducing power and antioxidant capacity in FRAP than those of BHT as a positive control. In addition, the extracts from the TQC leaf and stem showed stronger antioxidant activity than that of vitamin C, \u03b1-tocopherol in ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) methods. Cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effect of water extracts from TQC was also prevented t-BHP-induced toxicity in Chang liver cells. Therefore, these results indicate that TQC extracts have antioxidant properties through its ability to enhance the cell viability, reduction of production of ROS, inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondria dysfunction and ultimately inhibition of cell apoptosis. Based on the results described above, it is suggested that TQC has the potential to protect liver on t-BHP-induced cell damage and should be considered as a prospective functional food.", "date_completed": "20130501", "date_revised": "20161125"}
