(thyme oils) obtained from Loess Plateau in China had been studied. 130 constituents of thyme oils were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and carvacrol ethyl ether was firstly reported as a new natural product, which has been used as a synthetic flavoring substance with no safety concern. The thyme oils showed the anti-oxidant activity using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and conferred protection against oxidative stress in zebrafish. In addition, a class of carvacrol analogues was found to develop as potential natural antioxidant products of thyme oils from Loess Plateau by the correlation analysis. YL-thyme oil performed the best antioxidant activity in this research, which could be recommended as preferred sources of thyme oils. Furthermore, YL-thyme oil exhibited a potent antioxidant capacity by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, enhancing the endogenous antioxidant system, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in zebrafish.", "date_completed": "20210125", "date_revised": "20210709"}
