To achieve this goal, we examined the extract of <i>Thymus quinquecostatus</i> flowers, and identified a functional ingredient, galuteolin. Galuteolin effectively inhibited melanin biosynthesis in B16/F10 cells, partially suppressing tyrosinase activity. Therefore, this study suggests that galuteolin can be used as a cosmetic ingredient for skin whitening.", "date_revised": "20200518"}
