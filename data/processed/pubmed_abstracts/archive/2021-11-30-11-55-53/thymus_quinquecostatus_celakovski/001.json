In this study, we tested the DXR inhibitory effect of 35 plant essential oils (EOs), which have long been recognized for their antimicrobial properties. The results show that the EOs of <i>Zanbthoxylum bungeanum</i> (ZB), <i>Schizonepetae tenuifoliae</i> (ST), <i>Thymus quinquecostatus</i> (TQ), <i>Origanum vulgare</i> (OV), and <i>Eugenia caryophyllata</i> (EC) displayed weak to medium inhibitory activity against DXR, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 78 \u03bcg/mL, 65 \u03bcg/mL, 59 \u03bcg/mL, 48 \u03bcg/mL, and 37 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. GC-MS analyses of the above oils and further DXR inhibitory activity tests of their major components revealed that eugenol (EC) and carvacrol (TQ and OV) possess medium inhibition against the protein (68.3% and 55.6%, respectively, at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL), whereas thymol (ST, TQ, and OV), carveol (ZB), and linalool (ZB, ST, and OV) only exhibited weak inhibition against DXR, at 20 \u03bcg/mL (23%-26%). The results add more details to the antimicrobial mechanisms of plant EOs, which could be very helpful in the direction of the reasonable use of EOs in the food industry and in the control of phytopathogenic microbials.", "date_completed": "20191217", "date_revised": "20200225"}
