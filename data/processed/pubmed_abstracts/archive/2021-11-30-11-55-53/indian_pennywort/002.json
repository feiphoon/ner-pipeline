The extract itself as well as the 3 acids were found to be very weak sensitizers. Centella asiatica extract is used effectively in the treatment of keloids, leg ulcers, phlebitis, slow-healing wounds, leprosy, surgical lesions, striae distensae and cellulitis. Although applied frequently to damaged skin, the risk of acquiring contact sensitivity to this plant or its constituents is low.", "date_completed": "19940215", "date_revised": "20190721"}
