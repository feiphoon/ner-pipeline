Current management strategies include corticosteroids, which are limited due to side effects. Many herbal remedies are used traditionally but unfortunately have not been validated in controlled clinical trials. Three popular traditional treatments of eczema include Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. In this study three topical formulations (micro emulsion, gel and ointment) were prepared from extracts of Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. These formulations were monitored for stability for a period of three months. Controlled clinical trials were conducted on 360 eczema patients. Clinical parameters observed were degree of erythema, oedema, scaling, itching and lichenification. Effects of each formulation on these clinical parameters were compared with placebo formulations. Micro emulsion formulations in all cases proved to be more effective in reducing semi quantitative scores of erythema and oedema. Itching was relieved more by gel formulation. The ointment showed more efficacy towards scaling and lichenification. Comparison of the effects of placebo and the specific formulations was performed by chi-square statistics and found to be highly significant. In summary it is concluded that all the formulations could be used as promising source for treatment of eczema. ", "date_completed": "20160310", "date_revised": "20161126"}
