The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dairy cow diet supplementation with thyme oil and its main component thymol on intake and total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients, rumen fermentation characteristics, ruminal protozoa, nitrogen excretion, and milk production. For this aim, we used 8 multiparous, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in a replicated 4 \u00d7 4 Latin square design (28 d periods), balanced for residual effects. Cows were fed 1 of the 4 following experimental treatments: total mixed ration (TMR) with no additive (control); TMR + monensin [24 mg/kg of dry matter (DM)]; TMR + thyme oil (50 mg/kg of DM); and TMR + thymol (50 mg/kg of DM). Compared with the control diet, feeding thyme oil or thymol had no effect on DM intake, nutrient total-tract apparent digestibility, total N excretion, ruminal pH, ammonia concentration, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, or acetate:propionate ratio. Ruminal protozoa density was not modified by thyme oil, but decreased with thymol supplementation. Supplementation with thyme oil or thymol did not affect milk production, milk composition, or efficiency of milk production. Neither thyme oil nor thymol affected efficiency of dietary N use for milk N secretion (N intake/milk N). Supplementation with monensin tended to decrease DM intake (-1.2 kg/d) and milk fat yield. Total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients did not differ between cows fed monensin and cows fed the control diet. Total VFA concentration was not changed by monensin supplementation compared with control, but adding monensin shifted the VFA profile toward more propionate and less acetate, resulting in a decrease of acetate:propionate ratio. Protozoa density and ammonia concentration were lower in the ruminal content of cows fed monensin compared with that of cows fed the control diet. Total N excretion was not affected by monensin supplementation. Likewise, efficiency of use of dietary N for milk N secretion was unchanged in cows fed monensin. The results of this study contrasted with the claimed in vitro antimicrobial activity of thyme oil and thymol: we observed no positive effects on rumen metabolism (i.e., N and VFA) or milk performance in dairy cows. Under the conditions of this study, including thyme oil or thymol at 50 mg/kg of DM had no benefits for rumen fermentation, nutrient utilization and milk performance in dairy cows.", "date_completed": "20210226", "date_revised": "20210226"}
