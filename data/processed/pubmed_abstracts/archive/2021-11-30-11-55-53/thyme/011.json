In vitro activity against bacteria and molds of free oil as well as the encapsulated oil was verified and then in situ assay was done. The free thyme oil presented high in vitro activity, with values below 0.50mg/mL for almost all the microorganisms tested. Also, MIC values for the encapsulated oil was lower than for the free oil, probably due to the protective micro-environment promoted by the particle wall. The microparticles applied to cakes samples conferred protection against the volatilization of the encapsulated oil and promoted a minimum shelf life of 30days without the use of synthetic preservatives.", "date_completed": "20190409", "date_revised": "20190409"}
