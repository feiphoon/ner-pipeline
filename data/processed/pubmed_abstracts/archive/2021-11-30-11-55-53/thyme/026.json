Several essential oils (EOs) have displayed some antimicrobial activity and could potentially act as antibiotic adjuvants. Research in this area aims to develop new therapeutic alternatives to treat infections caused by these pathogens. MICs of different EOs were determined against A. baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays were used to study the synergy between the EOs and antibiotics. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC<sub>index</sub>) was calculated in order to categorize the interaction. Time-kill assays were also performed. The EOs that displayed the highest levels of antimicrobial activity were clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and thyme (Thymus zygis L.). Combined disk diffusion tests and checkerboard assays revealed synergy between these EOs and colistin. Addition of either clove or thyme EO decreased the MIC of colistin by 8- to 64-fold and 8- to 128-fold in the colistin-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively (FIC<sub>index</sub> \u2264 0.5, synergy). MICs were also reduced in the colistin-susceptible strains. Time-kill assays also indicated the strong activity of the combined therapy. In summary, the use of clove or thyme EO in combination with colistin could improve the efficacy of the antibiotic and significantly reduce the concentrations needed to inhibit growth of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae.", "date_completed": "20210319", "date_revised": "20210319"}
