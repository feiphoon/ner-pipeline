Characterization of the physicochemical properties of the MnO<sub>2</sub>/perlite-NCs was performed using XRD, FESEM, EDX, FT-IR, and DLS techniques. Furthermore, their effects on the phytochemical classification and growth parameters of H. perforatum shoot cultures were assessed. According to the FESEM image, the synthesized spherical MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on the sheet-like structure of nano-perlite were formed, ranging about 20-50\u00a0nm. In addition, based on the EDX spectra, the elemental analysis showed the presence of Carbon, Oxygen, Silicon, Aluminum, and Manganese elements in the as-synthesized MnO<sub>2</sub>/perlite-NCs. Biological studies confirmed that nano-perlite and MnO<sub>2</sub>/perlite-NCs were non-toxic to H. perforatum shoot cultures and showed positive effects on plant growth in specific concentrations. Overall, phytochemical classification demonstrated that the terpenoids decreased in the evaluated treatments, while hypericin and pseudohypericin were increased in some treatments (25, 50 and 150\u00a0mg/L of nano-perlite) relative to control. Metabolomics results suggested that both nano-perlite and MnO<sub>2</sub>/perlite-NCs can be used as elicitors and new nanofertilizers for generating some secondary metabolites.", "date_completed": "20210129", "date_revised": "20210129"}
