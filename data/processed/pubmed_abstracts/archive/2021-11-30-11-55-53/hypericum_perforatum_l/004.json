(St John's Wort).", "abstract": "Hyperforatins L-U, ten undescribed polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) bearing a terminal double bond, together with a known compound hypericumoxide J, were isolated from the aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum L. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including HRESIMS, IR, UV, and NMR (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY, and NOESY experiments). Their absolute configurations were determined by comprehensive analyses of their experimental ECD spectra in conjunction with a modified Mosher's method. Evaluation of their neuroprotective activities highlighted hyperforatin L, which displayed mild activity at a concentration of 10\u202f\u03bcM.", "date_completed": "20190806", "date_revised": "20190806"}
