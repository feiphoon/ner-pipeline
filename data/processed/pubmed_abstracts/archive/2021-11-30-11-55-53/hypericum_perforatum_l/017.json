Commercial Products Targeting the ITS Region.", "abstract": "There is considerable potential for the use of DNA barcoding methods to authenticate raw medicinal plant materials, but their application to testing commercial products has been controversial. A simple PCR test targeting species-specific sequences within the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was adapted to screen commercial products for the presence of <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> L. material. DNA differing widely in amount and extent of fragmentation was detected in a number of product types. Two assays were designed to further analyse this DNA using a curated database of selected <i>Hypericum</i> ITS sequences: A qPCR assay based on a species-specific primer pair spanning the ITS1 and ITS2 regions, using synthetic DNA reference standards for DNA quantitation and a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay separately targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions. The ability of the assays to detect <i>H. perforatum</i> DNA sequences in processed medicines was investigated. Out of twenty different matrices tested, both assays detected <i>H. perforatum</i> DNA in five samples with more than 10\u00b3 ITS copies \u00b5L<sup>-1</sup> DNA extract, whilst the qPCR assay was also able to detect lower levels of DNA in two further samples. The NGS assay confirmed that <i>H. perforatum</i> was the major species in all five positive samples, though trace contaminants were also detected.", "date_completed": "20191224", "date_revised": "20200309"}
