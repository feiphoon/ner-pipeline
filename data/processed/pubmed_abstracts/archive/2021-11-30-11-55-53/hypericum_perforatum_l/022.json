This activity is specific, as demonstrated by the comparison with other short-chain monocarboxylic acids. We have recently demonstrated that Hypericum perforatum root cultures constitutively produce xanthones at higher levels than the root of the plant and that they respond to chitosan (CHIT) elicitation with a noteworthy increase in xanthone production. In the present study, CHIT was administered to H. perforatum root cultures using three different elicitation protocols, and the increase in xanthone production was evaluated. The best results (550\u00a0% xanthone increase) were obtained by subjecting the roots to a single elicitation with 200\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) CHIT and maintaining the elicitor in the culture medium for 7\u00a0days. To discriminate the effect of CHIT from that of the solvent, control experiments were performed by administering AcOH alone at the same concentration used for CHIT solubilization. Unexpectedly, AcOH caused an increase in xanthone production comparable to that observed in response to CHIT. Feeding experiments with (13)C-labeled AcOH demonstrated that this compound was not incorporated into the xanthone skeleton. Other short-chain monocarboxylic acids (i.e., propionic and butyric acid) have little or no effect on the production of xanthones. These results indicate that AcOH acts as a specific signal molecule, able to greatly enhance xanthone biosynthesis in H. perforatum root cultures.", "date_completed": "20170105", "date_revised": "20200930"}
