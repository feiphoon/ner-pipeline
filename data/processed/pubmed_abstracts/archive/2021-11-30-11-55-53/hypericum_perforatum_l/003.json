A novel approach to the treatment of drug addiction is the use of natural products, and, in this context, preclinical evidence suggests that Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericum) is effective against alcohol and other substance use disorders. We hypothesised that Hypericum could also be useful as a treatment for cocaine use disorder, and so we set out to test its effectiveness in a mice model of cocaine addiction. In the first experiment we evaluated its effects on the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Adult male mice were conditioned with cocaine (25\u00a0mg/kg), cocaine with Hypericum (75, 150 or 300\u00a0mg/kg) or the plant extract alone (300\u00a0mg/kg). In the second experiment, we tested the effects of Hypericum on stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP. All the mice were conditioned with cocaine (25\u00a0mg/kg) and, after extinction of CPP, the reinstating effects of social defeat (alone or with 75, 150 or 300\u00a0mg/kg of Hypericum) were evaluated. All the doses of Hypericum prevented the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP. Furthermore, the plant extract dose-dependently reduced the reinstating effects of social defeat. Therefore, Hypericum is effective in reducing the rewarding effects of cocaine and prevents the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine CPP in mice. The mechanisms underlying these positive effects of Hypericum perforatum L. need to be determined by future research. Our results endorse Hypericum as a natural treatment for cocaine dependence.", "date_revised": "20210914"}
