Urb an is distributed widely in South America and Asia and is known as a therapeutic agent in folk medicine, capable of improving memory and treating several neurological disorders. Asiaticoside is one of the compounds found in C. asiatica leaves that is suggested to be responsible for its pharmacological potential. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is a group of enzymes that has abnormal activity in the central nervous system in some neuropsychiatric diseases. In this work, the asiaticoside present in C. asiatica water extract was quantified by HPLC analysis. We also evaluated the activity of subtypes of PLA(2) in cerebellar samples from rats after C. asiatica water extract treatment using a radioenzymatic assay. Asiaticoside was the major compound (84%) found in Centella water extract. We found a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of C. asiatica water extract on the activity of Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) and cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)). The inhibition of these enzymes in the brain suggests that C. asiatica may be useful to treat conditions associated with increased PLA(2) activity in the brain, such as epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis and other neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date_completed": "20090106", "date_revised": "20131121"}
