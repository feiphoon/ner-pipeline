Urb. hairy root cultures.", "abstract": "In this study, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the phytomass and triterpenoid production of diploid and tetraploid Centella asiatica hairy roots were investigated. Hairy root cultures were obtained from diploid and induced tetraploid plants of C. asiatica infected by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain ATCC 43057. MeJA triggered triterpenoid production in both ploidy hairy roots, whereas triterpenoids were not produced in the untreated hairy roots. Among the treatments, the 50\u2009\u00b5M MeJA treatment yielded the maximum triterpenoid production in diploid hairy roots of 27.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27\u2009\u00b5g/mg Dry weight (DW) total triterpenoid at day 21. For the tetraploid hairy root cultures, the 28th-day hairy root culture produced a maximum amount of triterpenoids of 16.29\u2009\u00b1\u20096.32\u2009\u00b5g/mg DW in response to the 50\u2009\u00b5M MeJA treatment, whereas the 100\u2009\u00b5M MeJA treatment produced a similar triterpenoid amount (16.31\u2009\u00b1\u20099.24\u2009\u00b5g/mg DW) at day 14. Moreover, in response to 50\u2009\u00b5M MeJA, we obtained different ratios of aglycone to glycoside, i.e., 1:7 and 1:2, between the diploid and tetraploid hairy root cultures. Asiaticoside was the dominant phytochemical, followed by asiatic acid and madecassic acid. This study provides valuable information for producing triterpenoids for C. asiatica commercial products and preparations by using hairy root cultures.", "date_completed": "20201201", "date_revised": "20210110"}
