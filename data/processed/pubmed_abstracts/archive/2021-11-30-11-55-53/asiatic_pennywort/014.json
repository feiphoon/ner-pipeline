In this study, pentacyclic triterpene-rich centella extract (PRE) was combined with Eudragit\u00ae EPO as a hydrophilic polymer using solvent evaporation to produce a solid dispersion (PRE-ESD). The optimum PRE/Eudragit ratio of 1:2 enhanced the solubility and dissolution of glycosides (AS >\u20093.5 folds, MS >\u20092 folds) and aglycones (AA >\u200965 folds and MA >\u200956 folds) in 0.1\u00a0N hydrochloric acid (pH\u00a01.2). DSC, XRD, and FT-IR analysis showed that the four pentacyclic triterpenes in PRE existed in the amorphous state in the solid dispersion. Moreover, almost 100% of the compounds were released from the solid dispersion within 2\u00a0h. The effects of PRE-ESD on cell proliferation and wound healing in vitro were investigated in human gastric epithelial cell lines (AGS cells). Exposure to PRE-ESD (equivalent to PRE concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) promoted cell proliferation and enhanced 'wound closure' in the scratch assay of wound healing by 82% compared with non-treated groups. Unformulated MA and AA aglycones did not exhibit a wound healing effect. Moreover, PRE-ESD was found to accelerate wound closure compared with either AS or MS, indicating that the wound healing properties of PRE-ESD are conferred by the active compounds AS and MS that are presented in PRE.", "date_completed": "20191213", "date_revised": "20191217"}
