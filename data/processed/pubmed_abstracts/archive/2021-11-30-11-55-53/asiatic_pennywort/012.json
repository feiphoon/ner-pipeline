The effect of various quantities of non-ionic surfactant (Montanov82) on liposomes upon physicochemical characteristics as well as their in vitro bio-activities was investigated. An addition of surfactant resulted in a decrease in particle size and an increase in percentage AP entrapment efficiency of liposomes. The surfactant-loaded liposomes demonstrated higher stability than surfactant-free liposomes where higher percentage AP remaining of liposomes can be achieved depending on surfactant concentration. No significant difference was found on AP release profiles among varied surfactant concentrations, although a presence of surfactant resulted in prolonged AP release rate. Liposomal AP with 20% w/w surfactant or higher demonstrated low cytotoxicity, a stronger anti-oxidation effect and collagen production on dermal fibroblast cells when compared with free AP and surfactant-free liposomes, possibly due to better cell internalization and less AP degradation in cells.", "date_completed": "20101129", "date_revised": "20100809"}
