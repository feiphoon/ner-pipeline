Fresh leaves of this plant are consumed in salads and beverages in a variety of cuisines around the world. This is a well-known functional food for its neuroprotective and cognition enhancing properties in traditional societies. HPLC-DAD at lower wavelengths commonly used to identify and quantify major triterpenes of C. asiatica extracts, but associated with few drawbacks. This paper discusses a specific, sensitive and validated method developed based on UHPLC-ESI-MS-MS-MRM tandem mass spectroscopy for targeted quantification of C. asiatica bioactive compounds. The validated method enabled a precise estimation of major triterpenes and chlorogenic acid in C. asiatica in a shorter time. The findings of this study will contribute to the information on chemotype variation of C. asiatica plant grown under unique geographical, environmental and climatic conditions in New Zealand.", "date_completed": "20211123", "date_revised": "20211123"}
