However, due to the low solubility and high molecular weight of pharmacologically active constituents, including asiatic acid (AA), madecassic acid (MA), and asiaticoside (AS), it is challenging to fabricate high-payload topical preparations of CA with satisfactory skin absorption profiles.", "date_completed": "20211124", "date_revised": "20211124"}
