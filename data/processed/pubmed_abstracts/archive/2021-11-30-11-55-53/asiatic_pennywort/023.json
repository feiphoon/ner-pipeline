Urban Extract: Implications for TTR Amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Transthyretin is responsible for a series of highly progressive, degenerative, debilitating, and incurable protein misfolding disorders known as transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. Since dissociation of the homotetrameric protein to its monomers is crucial in its amyloidogenesis, stabilizing the native tetramer from dissociating using small-molecule ligands has proven a viable therapeutic strategy. The objective of this study was to determine the potential role of the medicinal herb <i>Centella asiatica</i> on human transthyretin (huTTR) amyloidogenesis. Thus, we investigated the stability of huTTR with or without a hydrophilic fraction of <i>C. asiatica</i> (CAB) against acid/urea-mediated denaturation. We also determined the influence of CAB on huTTR fibrillation using transmission electron microscopy. The potential binding interactions between CAB and huTTR was ascertained by nitroblue tetrazolium redox-cycling and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid displacement assays. Additionally, the chemical profile of CAB was determined by liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). Our results strongly suggest that CAB bound to and preserved the quaternary structure of huTTR in vitro. CAB also prevented transthyretin fibrillation, although aggregate formation was unmitigated. These effects could be attributable to the presence of phenolics and terpenoids in CAB. Our findings suggest that <i>C. asiatica</i> contains pharmaceutically relevant bioactive compounds which could be exploited for therapeutic development against TTR amyloidosis.", "date_completed": "20190903", "date_revised": "20200225"}
