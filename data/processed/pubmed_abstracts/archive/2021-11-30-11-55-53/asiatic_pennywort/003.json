We tested the intra-articular pain relieving properties of a system of molecules from a characterized <i>Centella asiatica</i> extract (14G1862) in a rat model of osteoarthritis induced by monoiodoacetate (MIA). 14G1862 (0.2-2 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) was intra-articularly (i.a.) injected 7 days after MIA, behavioural and histological evaluations were performed 14, 30 and 60 days after treatments. Moreover, the effect of 14G1862 on nitrate production and iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS was assessed. <i>In vitro</i>, 14G1862 treatment attenuated LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression in a comparable manner to celecoxib. <i>In vivo</i>, 14G1862 significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia, spontaneous pain and motor alterations starting on day 14 up to day 60. The efficacy was higher or comparable to that evoked by triamcinolone acetonide (100 \u03bcg i.a.) used as reference drug. Histological evaluation highlighted the improvement of several morphological parameters in MIA + 14G1862-treated animals with particularly benefic effects on joint space and fibrin deposition. In conclusion, i.a. treatment with <i>Centella asiatica</i> is a candidate to be a novel effective approach for osteoarthritis therapy.", "date_completed": "20210219", "date_revised": "20210219"}
