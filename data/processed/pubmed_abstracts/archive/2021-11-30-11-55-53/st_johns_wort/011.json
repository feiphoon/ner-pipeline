The elemental profiles of 54 samples (i.e., dry herbs, tablets and capsules) were evaluated by monitoring 25 elements using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The major elemental constituents in the SJW samples were Ca (300-199,000\u03bcg/g), Mg (410-3,530\u03bcg/g), Al (4.4-900\u03bcg/g), Fe (1.154-760\u03bcg/g), Mn (2.4-261\u03bcg/g), Sr (0.88-83.6\u03bcg/g), and Zn (7-64\u03bcg/g). For the sixteen elements that could be reliably quantified, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate underlying patterns in the data. PCA models identified 7 key elements (i.e., Ba, Ca, Cd, Mg, Mo, Ni and Y), which described 85% of the variance in the dataset in the first three principal components. The PCA approach resulted in a general delineation between the three different formulations and provides a basis for monitoring product quality in this manner.
