An ethyl acetate (AcOEt) soluble fraction of methanol extract of H. erectum showed the activity. The AcOEt fraction was separated by various successive choromatographical methods to give seven new compounds 1-7 along with some known compounds. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated to be polyprenylated benzoylphloroglucinol derivatives by means of HR-MS and NMR spectra including 2D-NMR. Some of these compounds had novel cage structures having benzoyltricyclo[3,3,1,1(3,7)]decane and benzoyltricyclo[4,3,1,1(3,8)]undecane skeletons arising from a polyprenylated phloroglucinol precursor by a transannular cyclization reaction. The isolated compounds were tested for suppressive activity, but they showed only weak activity.", "date_completed": "20100615", "date_revised": "20191210"}
