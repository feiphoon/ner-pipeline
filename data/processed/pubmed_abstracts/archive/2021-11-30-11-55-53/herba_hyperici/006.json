(aerial part of St. John's Wort) is still topical due to some hard-to-beat medicinal attributes of these bioactive compounds. Unfortunately, their low bioavailability (0.06%-0.4%) complicates the extraction process. Therefore, developing straightforward and lower-cost methodologies for NT separation is still a priority. In support of this purpose, for preparing NT formulations from flowers and leaves of wild St. John's Wort (hyperici herba), a cutoff preparative methodology is described herein. Combining Soxhlet extraction and reflux extraction, some concentrated and rather pure NT ethanolic-based formulations without chlorophyl and grease were obtained.", "date_completed": "20200915", "date_revised": "20200915"}
