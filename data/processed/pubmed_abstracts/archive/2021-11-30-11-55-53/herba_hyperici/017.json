The experimentally determined optimal conditions for tincture preparation were as follows: concentration of ethanol--70% (V/V), the particle size of the leaves, herb, flowers--2.0-3.0 mm, for the bark and the roots--0.3-0.5 mm, the extraction method--percolation. The quality of the tincture was evaluated by analyzing the sum of flavonoids (recalculated into equivalent amount of rutin), dry residue, the concentration of ethanol, density of the extractive preparation, and microbial contamination. Also the overall appearance was checked, the identification of flavonoids was performed by color reactions and high-pressure liquid chromatography.", "date_completed": "20030212", "date_revised": "20180614"}
