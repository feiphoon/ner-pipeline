Therefore, the content of essential elements together with total flavonoids was analyzed in 65 commercially available samples of herbal drugs originating from Ukraine, Romania, and Belarus. The results showed that metallic elements (in mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> d.w.) have occurred in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu, both for total and water-extractable species. Total flavonoids were determined in the range from 10.0 to 191.8\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> d.w. Several significant correlations have been found between the analytes, especially among water-extractable Fe with other metals, and total flavonoids and Fe, Zn, and Mn. Analysis of variance has revealed significant differences among studied samples due to their origin from different countries, especially between Belarussian samples and others. Differences owing to belonging to various plant species were also found, as it was noticed in the case of Polygoni aviculare herba in comparison with other botanical plant species. Moreover, multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to gather herbal drugs based on similarity of chemical composition. CA grouped the samples into clusters with similar level of elements and total flavonoid contents, and PCA has indicated Hyperici herba, Tiliae flores, and Crataegi fructus as herbal remedies with close concentration of studied elements and flavonoids.", "date_completed": "20180820", "date_revised": "20200303"}
