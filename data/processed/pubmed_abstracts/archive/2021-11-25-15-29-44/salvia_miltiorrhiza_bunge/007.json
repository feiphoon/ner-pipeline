A few chromatographic- or spectrometric-based methods have already been used to analyze the lipid-soluble components in SMB. However, the methodology of qNMR on the extracts of fresh SMB root has not been verified so far. The purpose of this study was to establish a fast and simple method to quantify the tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, dihydrotanshinone, and cryptotanshinone in fresh <i>Salvia Miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge root without any pre-purification steps using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. The process is as follows: first, 70% methanol aqueous extracts of fresh <i>Salvia Miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge roots were quantitatively analyzed for tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, dihydrotanshinone, and cryptotanshinone using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Different internal standards were tested and the validated method was compared with HPLC. 3,4,5-trichloropyridine was chosen as the internal standard. Twelve samples of <i>Salvia Miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge were quantitatively analyzed by qNMR and HPLC respectively. Then, the results were analyzed by chemometric approaches. This NMR method offers a fast, stable, and accurate analysis of four ketones: tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, dihydrotanshinone, and cryptotanshinone in fresh roots of <i>Salvia Miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge.", "date_completed": "20210225", "date_revised": "20210420"}
