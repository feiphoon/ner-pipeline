Studies have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, also renowned in traditional Chinese medicine, is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment. Among the extraction solvents investigated, a 50% ethanol (EtOH) extract of A. pilosa produced the highest anti-nociceptive effect in monosodium uric acid-induced gout pain models and the greatest yield. The 80% EtOH extract of S. miltiorrhiza moderately inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide release from RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and exhibited outstanding yield. The mixture of optimized A. pilosa and S. miltiorrhiza extracts were evaluated for enhanced anti-nociceptive effects in gout arthritis treatment. To control extract quality, four marker compounds were determined using an HPLC-DAD method. A 1:1 mixture of A. pilosa 50 and S. miltiorrhiza 80% EtOH extracts of produced better results than when the extracts were administered individually.", "date_completed": "20181015", "date_revised": "20181015"}
