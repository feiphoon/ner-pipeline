By screening the genome sequences of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, 225 SmWD40 genes were identified and divided into 9 subfamilies (I-IX). Physiological, biochemical, gene structure, conserved protein motif and GO annotation analyses were performed on SmWD40 family members. The SmWD40-170 was found in 110 SmWD40 genes that contain drought response elements, SmWD40-170 was one of these genes whose response in terms of expression under drought was significant. The expression of SmWD40-170 was also up-regulated by ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Through observed the stomatal phenotype of SmWD40-170 transgenic lines, the stomatal closure was abolished under dehydration, ABA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in SmWD40-170 knockdown lines. Abscisic acid (ABA), as the key phytohormone, elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels under drought stress. The ABA-ROS interaction mediated the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the activation of anion channel in guard cells. The osmolality alteration of guard cells further accelerated the stomatal closure. As a second messenger, nitric oxide (NO) regulated ABA signaling, the NO stimulated protein kinase activity inhibited the K<sup>+</sup> influx which result in stomatal closure. These NO-relevant events were essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. The reduction of NO production was also observed in the guard cells of SmWD40-170 knockdown lines. The abolished of stomatal closure attributed to the SmWD40-170 deficiency induced the reduction of NO content. In general, the SmWD40-170 is a critical drought response gene in SmWD40 gene family and regulates ABA- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stomatal movement by affecting the synthesis of NO.", "date_completed": "20200911", "date_revised": "20200930"}
