{"abstract": "In-stent restenosis (ISR) is the main factor affecting the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and its main pathological feature is neointimal hyperplasia. Huotan Jiedu Tongluo decoction (HTJDTLD) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription for the treatment of vascular stenosis diseases. However, the precise anti-ISR mechanism of HTJDTLD remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether HTJDTLD can inhibit the excessive activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and reduce the level of autophagy factors through regulating the PERK-eIF2", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, Jilin, China.\nHospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Tenghui", "initials": "T", "lastname": "Tian"}, {"affiliation": "Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Keying", "initials": "K", "lastname": "Yu"}, {"affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Miao", "initials": "M", "lastname": "Zhang"}, {"affiliation": "Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Xiao", "initials": "X", "lastname": "Shao"}, {"affiliation": "Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Liping", "initials": "L", "lastname": "Chang"}, {"affiliation": "Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Rui", "initials": "R", "lastname": "Shi"}, {"affiliation": "Jilin Ginseng Academy, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Baojin", "initials": "B", "lastname": "Yao"}, {"affiliation": "Hospital of Affiliated Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Yue", "initials": "Y", "lastname": "Deng"}], "conclusions": null, "copyrights": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Tenghui Tian et al.", "doi": "10.1155/2021/5536237", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "keywords": [], "methods": null, "publication_date": "2021-08-03", "pubmed_id": "34335815\n7156611\n29843465\n30551396\n26417060\n12438434\n27684727\n27932512\n11025836\n30453089\n26315405\n30081573\n21967674\n10969032\n31518878\n27478114\n18038217\n25663310\n30542486\n27180022\n16901900\n16805218\n24099026\n28875043\n17665547\n19635543\n28425161\n24832819\n23532779\n16200199\n21889469\n30119175\n32215348\n31992061\n25635126\n26490017\n31639278\n29531800\n22445600\n28067409\n17612585\n24589849\n30784667\n31408662\n25373918\n23623713\n16794605\n30820153\n32104293\n25463547\n20884885\n12438433\n31523192\n22651862\n17565364\n33536065\n32963706\n9038370\n23238393\n11352893\n28951205\n25994755", "results": null, "title": "Huotan Jiedu Tongluo Decoction Inhibits Balloon-Injury-Induced Carotid Artery Intimal Hyperplasia in the Rat through the PERK-eIF2", "xml": "<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x111c76cc0>"}
