{"abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction in the treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infection (RRTI) using network pharmacology.\nTo screen the active ingredients of A Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction, TCMSP, TCMID, Batman-TCM and PubChem database were applied. To predict the targets of active ingredients on RRTI, TCMSP, Pubmed, OMIM, Drug Bank, GAD and TTD database were used. The compounds-therapeutic target network was constructed with Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. The STRING database was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify potential signal pathways.\nThe 3 main active ingredients of Modified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction obtained by screening were quercetin, kaempferol, and isoflavone; the main therapeutic targets were \nModified Ginseng-Schisandra Decoction can treat RRTI primarily through acting in the signal transduction of some key nodes of cancer pathway and TNF pathway. It exerts a direct or indirect influence on multiple signaling pathways, and has the characteristics of multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action.", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.", "firstname": "Qing-Ke", "initials": "QK", "lastname": "Cui"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.", "firstname": "Hua", "initials": "H", "lastname": "Li"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.", "firstname": "Zhan", "initials": "Z", "lastname": "Li"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.", "firstname": "Jie", "initials": "J", "lastname": "Li"}, {"affiliation": "Jilin Province Jilin Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Jilin, China.", "firstname": "Liqi", "initials": "L", "lastname": "Song"}], "conclusions": null, "copyrights": "2021 Translational Pediatrics.
