{"abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most important problems affecting both social and professional life of patients. There is no treatment method considered to be successful on the hearing loss that has become a permanent nature. Aim of this study is to evaluate protective effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) against NIHL in an animal model.\nTwenty-eight rats were separated into four groups [control saline (group I), control KRG (group II), saline + noise (group III), KRG + noise (group IV)]. Rats in the saline and KRG groups were fed via oral gavage with a dose of 200 mg/kg/day throughout for 10 days. Fourteen rats (group III and IV) were exposed to 4 kHz octave band noise at 120 dB SPL for 5 hours. Hearing levels of rats were evaluated by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 kHz frequencies prior to and on days 1, 7 and 10 after the noise exposure. Rats were sacrificed on 10th day, after the last audiological test. Cochlea and spiral ganglion tissues were evaluated by light microscopy.\nAudiological and histological results demonstrated that after noise the group IV showed better results than group III. In the noise exposed groups, the most prominent damage was seen at the 8 kHz frequency region than other regions. After the noise exposure, DPOAE responses were lost in 1st, 7th and 10th measurements in both group III and IV. Thus, we were not able to perform any statistical analyses for DPOAE results.\nOur findings suggest that KRG seems to be an efficient agent against NIHL. There is need for additional research to find out about the mechanisms of KRG's protective effect.", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Audiology Programme, Institute of Health Sciences, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.\nDepartment of Audiometry, Vocational School of Health Services, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Serpil", "initials": "S", "lastname": "Mungan Durankaya"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Y\u00fcksel", "initials": "Y", "lastname": "Olgun"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Basic Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Safiye", "initials": "S", "lastname": "Akta\u015f"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Audiometry, Vocational School of Health Services, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Hande Evin", "initials": "HE", "lastname": "Eskicio\u011flu"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Audiometry, Vocational School of Health Services, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Selhan", "initials": "S", "lastname": "G\u00fcrkan"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Basic Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Zekiye", "initials": "Z", "lastname": "Altun"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Audiology, School of Health Sciences, Medeniyet University, \u0130stanbul, Turkey.", "firstname": "Ba\u015fak", "initials": "B", "lastname": "Mutlu"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Efsun", "initials": "E", "lastname": "Kolatan"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Ersoy", "initials": "E", "lastname": "Do\u011fan"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "Osman", "initials": "O", "lastname": "Y\u0131lmaz"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Audiometry, Vocational School of Health Services, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University \u0130zmir, Turkey.", "firstname": "G\u00fcnay", "initials": "G", "lastname": "K\u0131rk\u0131m"}], "conclusions": null, "copyrights": "\u00a9Copyright 2021 by Official Journal of the Turkish Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery.", "doi": "10.4274/tao.2021.2021-1-5", "journal": "Turkish archives of otorhinolaryngology", "keywords": ["Noise", "animal experimentation", "antioxidants", "audiology", "ginseng", "noise-induced hearing loss", "treatment"], "methods": null, "publication_date": "2021-08-14", "pubmed_id": "34386797\n32792910\n12352659\n25894725\n17081714\n15659607\n20004700\n17141991\n24182331\n10913881\n31308807\n2613569\n23560064\n27916698\n27487360\n20020438\n15862892\n17296266\n21059389\n23164932\n20969919\n23933362\n24952098\n21541943", "results": null, "title": "Effect of Korean Red Ginseng on Noise-Induced Hearing Loss.", "xml": "<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x111a04c70>"}
