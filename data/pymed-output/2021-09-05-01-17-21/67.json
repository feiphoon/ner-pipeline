{"abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP), one of the most common antipyretic analgesics, which is safe at therapeutic dose, cause acute liver injury and even death at overdose. However, the mechanism of APAP-induced inflammation in liver injury is still controversial. Therefore, effective drug intervention is urgently needed. The aim of this study was to explore the inflammatory exact mechanism of APAP, especially on neutrophils, and to study the intervention effect of ", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of
