{"abstract": "To assess the efficacy and safety of PNS on antiplatelet therapy in the treatment of AIS.\nWe searched 7 literature databases and 2 clinical studies databases for randomized controlled studies (RCTs) evaluating PNS as an adjuvant therapy for AIS. Relevant studies were retrieved and screened, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis was carried out with the Rev Man 5.4 software.\nOf 8267 records identified, 43 RCTs met our inclusion criteria (\nPNS may be effective and safe in treating AIS on ameliorating neurological deficit, improving activities of daily living function, and enhancing antiplatelet effects. However, more high-quality evidence is needed before it can be recommended for routine antiplatelet therapy in patients with AIS.", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China.\nCenter for Evidence-based Chinese Medicine, Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.", "firstname": "Liu-Ding", "initials": "LD", "lastname": "Wang"}, {"affiliation": "Graduate School, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.", "firstname": "Zhen-Min", "initials": "ZM", "lastname": "Xu"}, {"affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China.", "firstname": "Xiao", "initials": "X", "lastname": "Liang"}, {"affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China.", "firstname": "Wen-Ran", "initials": "WR", "lastname": "Qiu"}, {"affiliation": "Graduate School, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.", "firstname": "Shao-Jiao", "initials": "SJ", "lastname": "Liu"}, {"affiliation": "Graduate School, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.", "firstname": "Ling-Ling", "initials": "LL", "lastname": "Dai"}, {"affiliation": "Graduate School, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.", "firstname": "Ye-Fei", "initials": "YF", "lastname": "Wang"}, {"affiliation": "Graduate School, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.", "firstname": "Chun-Yan", "initials": "CY", "lastname": "Guo"}, {"affiliation": "The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250014, China.", "firstname": "Xiang-Hua", "initials": "XH", "lastname": "Qi"}, {"affiliation": "The Affiliated Hospital to Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130021, China.", "firstname": "Jian", "initials": "J", "lastname": "Wang"}, {"affiliation": "Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China.", "firstname": "Yan-Bing", "initials": "YB", "lastname": "Ding"}, {"affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China.", "firstname": "Yun-Ling", "initials": "YL", "lastname": "Zhang"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Evidence-based Chinese Medicine, Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China.", "firstname": "Xing", "initials": "X", "lastname": "Liao"}], "conclusions": null, "copyrights": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Liu-ding Wang et al.", "doi": "10.1155/2021/4694076", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "keywords": [], "methods": null, "publication_date": "2021-08-03", "pubmed_id": "34335808\n33362701\n32495573\n23418571\n29896950\n28817486\n23073197\n28654957\n28877716\n32714181\n27917359\n22713488\n31657263\n27184032\n19107746\n26662670\n30484022\n21208779\n22407229\n30499555\n15143716\n31471773", "results": null, "title": "Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Randomized Controlled Trials on Efficacy and Safety of Panax Notoginseng Saponins in Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke.", "xml": "<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x111c8dd60>"}
