{"abstract": "Gintonin is a kind of ginseng-derived glycolipoprotein that acts as an exogenous LPA receptor ligand. Gintonin has in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effects; however, little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection. In the present study, we aimed to clarify how gintonin attenuates iodoacetic acid (IAA)-induced oxidative stress. The mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 was used. Gintonin treatment significantly attenuated IAA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, ATP depletion, and cell death. However, treatment with Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, suppressed the neuroprotective effects of gintonin. Gintonin elicited [Ca", "authors": [{"affiliation": "Ginsentology Research Laboratory and Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.", "firstname": "Yeon-Jin", "initials": "YJ", "lastname": "Cho"}, {"affiliation": "Ginsentology Research Laboratory and Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.", "firstname": "Sun-Hye", "initials": "SH", "lastname": "Choi"}, {"affiliation": "Ginsentology Research Laboratory and Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.", "firstname": "Ra-Mi", "initials": "RM", "lastname": "Lee"}, {"affiliation": "Ginsentology Research Laboratory and Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.", "firstname": "Han-Sung", "initials": "HS", "lastname": "Cho"}, {"affiliation": "Center for Neuroscience, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul 02792, Korea.", "firstname": "Hyewhon", "initials": "H", "lastname": "Rhim"}, {"affiliation": "Neuropsychopharmacology and Toxicology Program, College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 24341, Korea.", "firstname": "Hyoung-Chun", "initials": "HC", "lastname": "Kim"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Longevity and Biofunctional Medicine, Pusan National University School of Korean Medicine, Yangsan 50612, Korea.", "firstname": "Byung-Joo", "initials": "BJ", "lastname": "Kim"}, {"affiliation": "Biosafety Research Institute, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Baekje-daero 567, Jeonju 28644, Korea.", "firstname": "Jong-Hoon", "initials": "JH", "lastname": "Kim"}, {"affiliation": "Ginsentology Research Laboratory and Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Korea.", "firstname": "Seung-Yeol", "initials": "SY", "lastname": "Nah"}], "conclusions": null, "copyrights": null, "doi": "10.3390/molecules26144138", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "keywords": ["BDNF/TrkB/Akt", "ginseng", "gintonin", "hippocampal cell line", "neuroprotection", "oxidative stress"], "methods": null, "publication_date": "2021-07-25", "pubmed_id": "34299412\n32617037\n28098423\n17765210\n27525050\n22685618\n23717063\n30364203\n3951656\n33646749\n3605592\n29731711\n30853569\n32817818\n32603820\n7953717\n32183094\n29106705\n31817172\n24643338\n29675576\n29570621\n31861353\n31364025\n28815598\n18718180\n28110215\n30472367\n9157970\n9581763\n33953832\n19787777\n25445364\n27765516\n22286231\n33134079\n30962735\n26578955\n26557222\n10508238", "results": null, "title": "Protective Effects of Gintonin on Reactive Oxygen Species-Induced HT22 Cell Damages: Involvement of LPA1 Receptor-BDNF-AKT Signaling Pathway.", "xml": "<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x111d31e00>"}
