    "abstract": "Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) as the main effective substances from P. notoginseng with low bioavailability could be bio-converted by human gut microbiota. In our previous study, PNS metabolic variations mediated by gut microbiota have been observed between high fat, high protein (HF-HP) and low fat, plant fiber-rich (LF-PF) dietary subjects. In this study, we aimed to correspondingly characterize the relationship between distinct gut microbial species and PNS metabolites.\nGut microbiota were collected from HF-HP and LF-PF dietary healthy adults and profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. PNS were incubated with gut microbiota in vitro. A LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify the five main metabolites yields including ginsenoside F\nThe five main metabolites were significantly different between the two diet groups. Compared with HF-HP group, the microbial genus Blautia, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Dorea, Enhydrobacter, Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, SMB53, Streptococcus, Treponema and Weissella were enriched in LF-PF group, while Phascolarctobacterium and Oscillospira were relatively decreased. Furthermore, Spearman's correlative analysis revealed gut microbials enriched in LF-PF and HF-HP groups were positively and negatively associated with the five metabolites, respectively.\nOur data showed gut microbiota diversity led to the personalized bioconversion of PNS.",
