    "abstract": "Cereboost\u00ae, an American ginseng extract, has shown improved short-term memory and attention/alertness in healthy young and middle-aged individuals, potentially via modulation of the gut microbiome and upregulation of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine. Here, we explored the effects of Cereboost\u00ae on cognition and mood in the first 6\u00a0h post intervention (acute), after 2\u00a0weeks daily supplementation (chronic), and whether 2\u00a0weeks daily supplementation altered the response to a single acute dose (acute-on-chronic). A concurrent in vitro study evaluated effects of repeated Cereboost\u00ae administration on human gut microbiota.\nCognitive effects of Cereboost\u00ae were assessed using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with 61 healthy young adults. Modulation of the gut microbiome was concurrently modelled using the Simulator of the Human Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME\u00ae), using a young adult donor.\nConsistent with previous findings, Cereboost\u00ae improved working memory and attention during the immediate postprandial period; effects that were amplified following two weeks' treatment (acute-on-chronic) compared to acute testing alone. Chronic supplementation improved cognition on an acetylcholine-sensitive attention task and improved mental fatigue and self-assurance aspects of mood. The parallel in vitro study revealed significantly increased acetate, propionate, and butyrate levels in simulated proximal and distal colon regions, linked with observed increases in Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus.\nThis study confirmed the promising effects of Cereboost\u00ae on cognitive function and mood, while suggesting a possible link to alterations of the gut microbiome and modulation of acetylcholine. Further studies will be required to unravel the underlying mechanisms that are involved.\nThe study was pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 6th July 2018 (Identifier: NCT03579095).",
