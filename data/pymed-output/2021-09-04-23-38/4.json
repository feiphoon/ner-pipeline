    "abstract": "As a dangerous disease with rapid progression, endotoxemia is easy to induce the damage to multiple organs. However, its specific and efficient treatment methods are still lacking at present. Both Qingkailing Injection(QKLI) and Shengmai Injection(SMI) have been proved effective in anti-inflammation, anti-endotoxin and organ protection. In this study, carrageenan and endotoxin were injected successively into rats to establish an endotoxemia model. Different doses of QKLI and SMI were administered to the endotoxemia rats by intraperitoneal injection separately or in combination. Then the count of white blood cells, the number of platelets, the content of cytokines, biochemical indexes, organ coefficient and pathological changes of main organs in the rats were detected. The results showed that the rats in the model group had obvious symptoms of endotoxemia, i.e., leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, increase in cytokines(IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and biochemical indexes of liver and kidney function as well as pathological damage to liver, kidney and lung. QKLI alone can alleviate the above symptoms of endotoxemia and the organ injury. SMI alone is less effective in improving disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) and cytokine secretion complicated with endotoxemia, but capable of reducing the inflammation degree of the lung, liver and kidney. The combination of QKLI and SMI remarkably increased the number of platelets in the peripheral blood, improved the liver and kidney function and reduced inflammatory factors, with lung, liver, kidney and other organ structures protected well. Moreover, the improvement effect of the combination of QKLI and SMI was stronger than those of the two injections alone at fixed doses, indicative of a synergistic effect.",
