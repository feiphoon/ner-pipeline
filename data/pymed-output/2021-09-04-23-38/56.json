    "abstract": "A rapid nanoconfined liquid phase filtration system (NLPF) based on solvent-confined carbon nanofibers/carbon fiber materials (CNFs/CFs) was proposed to effectively remove chlorinated pesticides from ginsenosides-containing ginseng extracts. A series of major parameters that may affect the separation performance of the CNFs-NLPF method were extensively investigated, including the water solubility of nanoconfined solvents, filtration rate, ethanol content of the ginseng extracts, and reusability of the material for repeated adsorption. The developed method showed a high removal efficiency of pesticides (85.5-97.5%), high retainment rate of ginsenosides (95.4-98.9%), and consistent reproducibility (RSD < 11.8%). Furthermore, the feasibility of the CNFs-NLPF technique to be scaled-up for industrial application was systematically explored by analyzing large-volume ginseng extract (1 L), which also verified its excellent modifiable characteristic. This filtration method exhibits promising potential as a practical tool for removing pesticide residues and other organic pollutants in food samples to assure food quality and safeguard human health.",
