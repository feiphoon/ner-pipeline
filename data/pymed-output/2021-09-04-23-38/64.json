    "abstract": "A new compound named koninginin W (1) and four known polyketides (2-5) were isolated from endophytic fungus Trichoderma koningiopsis YIM PH30002 of Panax notoginseng. The structures of 1 - 5, including absolute configuration of 1, were elucidated on the detailed analysis of the HR-ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallographic data. Koninginin W (1) presented weak antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium.",
