    "abstract": "To summarize and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shenmai Injection in the treatment of viral myocarditis, shock, pulmonary heart disease, coronary heart disease, neutropenia and tumor chemotherapy, so as to provide supportive evidences for clinical rational use of Shenmai Injection. By searching literatures about studies on the systematic reviews on Shenmai Injection in treatment of viral myocarditis, shock, pulmonary heart disease, coronary heart disease, neutropenia and tumor chemotherapy from the main Chinese and English databases. Primary efficacy and safety outcome measures were selected for comparative analysis and summary, and the appraisal tool of AMSTAR 2 was used to evaluate the included studies.A total of 36 systematic reviews(published from 2005 to 2020) were included, involving viral myocarditis, shock, pulmonary heart disease, malignant tumor and coronary heart disease. The number of cases included in each type of the above diseases was 3 840, 2 484, 12 702, 28 036 and 27 082, respectively. The comparison results showed that, Shenmai Injection combined with conventional/western medicine treatment groups had better efficacy than conventional/western medicine groups alone in the prevention and treatment of the above five diseases. The main adverse reactions of Shenmai Injection reported in the included studies were facial flushing, rash, palpitation, etc., but the incidence was low and the general symptoms were mild, so no special treatment was needed. Therefore, the application of Shenmai Injection on the basis of conventional treatment or western medicine treatment had better prevention and treatment efficacy of the diseases. It was suggested that more multi-center and larger sample-size randomized controlled trials should be carried out in the future, and the relevant reporting standards should be strictly followed in systematic reviews, so as to improve the scientificity and transparency of the study.",
