    "abstract": "When testing botanical ingredients of herbal medicines and dietary supplements, the complexity of botanical matrixes often requires the use of orthogonal methods to establish identification procedures suitable for quality control purposes. Genomic-based botanical identification methods are evolving and emerging as useful quality control tools to complement traditional morphological and chemical identification methods. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction methods are being evaluated for botanical quality control and as a cost-effective approach to identify and discriminate between closely related botanical species. This paper describes orthogonal identification of ",
