    "abstract": "Depression is an inflammation-associated disease that results in major depression as inflammation increases and progresses. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), the major bioactive ingredient derived from ginseng, possesses remarkable anti-depressant and anti-inflammatory effects. Our previous studies showed that the pathogenesis of depression was concomitant with the acceleration of connexin43 (Cx43) ubiquitin degradation, while Rg1 could upregulate Cx43 expression to attenuate depression. However, whether the ubiquitination of Cx43 is the specific correlation between depression and inflammation, and how Rg1 ameliorates neuroinflammation to attenuate depression, are still under investigation.
