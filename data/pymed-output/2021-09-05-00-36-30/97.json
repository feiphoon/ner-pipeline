    "abstract": "Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of kinases and shares a highly conserved kinase domain with other mitogen-activated protein kinase family members. The activation of NLK contributes to the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), reducing c-myb expression and mechanistic target of rapamycin activity, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target. Unlike other anemias, the hematopoietic effects of DBA are largely restricted to the erythroid lineage. Mutations in ribosomal genes induce ribosomal insufficiency and reduced protein translation, dramatically impacting early erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of patients with DBA. We sought to identify compounds that suppress NLK and increases erythropoiesis in ribosomal insufficiency. We report that the active component of ginseng, ginsenoside Rb1, suppresses NLK expression and improves erythropoiesis in in\u00a0vitro models of DBA. Ginsenoside Rb1-mediated suppression of NLK occurs through the upregulation of miR-208, which binds to the 3'-UTR of NLK mRNA and targets it for degradation. We also compare ginsenoside Rb1-mediated upregulation of miR-208 with metformin-mediated upregulation of miR-26. We conclude that targeting NLK expression through miRNA binding of the unique 3'-UTR is a viable alternative to the challenges of developing small-molecule inhibitors to target the highly conserved kinase domain of this specific kinase.",
