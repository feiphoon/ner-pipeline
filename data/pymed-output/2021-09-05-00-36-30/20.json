    "abstract": "Minor ginsenosides, such as compounds (C)-K and C-Y, possess relatively better bioactivity than those of naturally occurring major ginsenosides. Therefore, this study focused on the biotransformation of major ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides using crude \u03b2-glucosidase preparation isolated from submerged liquid culture of ",
