    "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rg3, extracted from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, has been shown to possess neuroprotective properties. The present study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg3 on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice. Rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, leads to the augmentation of reactive oxygen species production in cells. Male C57/BL6 mice were intragastrically administered rotenone (30\u00a0mg/kg) and then treated with ginsenoside Rg3 (5, 10, or 20\u00a0mg/kg). Pole, rotarod, and open field tests were performed to evaluate motor function. Ginsenoside Rg3 decreased the climbing time in the pole test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas it increased the latency in the rotarod test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the total distance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and mean speed in the open field test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment augmented the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), mean density of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive nerve fibers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and dopamine content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the striatum and reduced the reactive oxygen species level in the substantia nigra (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Glutathione cysteine ligase regulatory subunit and glutathione cysteine ligase modulatory subunit expression levels were elevated in the ginsenoside Rg3 groups. Ginsenoside Rg3 also improved motor function in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice. The neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg3 are at least partly associated with its anti-oxidative properties via regulation of glutathione cysteine ligase modulatory subunit and glutathione cysteine ligase regulatory subunit expression.",
