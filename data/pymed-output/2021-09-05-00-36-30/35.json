    "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by a variety of heart problems, with a high incidence. The 5-year survival rate of patients with clinical symptoms is similar to that of malignant tumors. Wenyang Zhenshuai granules are a safe and effective granule of traditional Chinese medicine components, including aconite, dried ginger, licorice, and red ginseng. In contemporary clinical applications, it is widely used in acute and chronic heart insufficiency, coronary heart disease, and arrhythmia. This research cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes and divided them into the normal control group, LncRNA-MiR143HG overexpression group, LncRNA-MiR143HG silence group, Adriamycin (ADR) group, ADR\u2009+\u2009medicated serum group, ADR\u2009+\u2009LncRNA-MiR143HG overexpression\u2009+\u2009medicated serogroup, and ADR\u2009+\u2009LncRNA-MiR143HG silence\u2009+\u2009medicated serogroup. The cells of each group were treated differently, and the survival rate of each group of cells and the expression levels of LncRNA-MiR143HG/miR-143 and ERK5 were detected at the end of the experiment, and the expression of LncRNA-MiR143HG/miR-143 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes was regulated by Wenyang Zhenshuai granules' impact. The results of this study showed that, in the doxorubicin-induced H9C2 cardiomyocyte injury model, the expression of miR-143 was upregulated, and the expression of LncRNA-MiR143HG and ERK5 was significantly downregulated. Wenyang Zhenshuai granules can downregulate the expression of miR-143 to promote ERK5 protein expression and phosphorylation. The process is regulated by LncRNA-MiR143HG/miR-143, which may be one of its important mechanisms for the treatment of chronic heart failure.",
