    "abstract": "In this study, an analytical method was developed for the rapid determination of 21 pesticides used in ginseng cultivation. All pesticides covered by this method have been registered by 2020 in China for use on ginseng. The extracts were cleaned up using zirconium-oxide-modified silica (Z-Sep) and primary secondary amine (PSA). The combination of Z-Sep and PSA provided good recovery for all analytes and the cleanest matrix background out of a number of PSA-based sorbent combinations, as indicated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). Instrumental analysis was completed in 5\u2009min using the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The linearity (",
