    "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) injury is a serious complication of neonatal asphyxia and the leading cause of neonatal acute death and chronic neurological injury, and the effective therapeutic method is lacking to improve patients' outcomes. We reported in this study that panax notoginseng saponin (PNS) may provide a treatment option for HI. HI model was established using neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and then intraperitoneally injected with different dosage of PNS, once a day for 7\u00a0days. Histological staining and behavioural evaluations were performed to elucidate the pathological changes and neurobehavioural variation after PNS treatment. We found PNS administration significantly reduced the infarct volume of brain tissues and improved the autonomous activities of neonatal rats, especially with higher dosage. PNS treatment at 40\u2009mg/kg reduced neuronal damage, suppressed neuronal apoptosis and depressed astroglial reactive response. Moreover, the long-term cognitive and motor functions were also improved after PNS treatment at 40\u2009mg/kg. Importantly, PNS treatment elevated the levels of BDNF and TrkB but decreased the expression of p75NTR both in the cortex and hippocampus of HI rats. The therapeutic efficacy of PNS might be correlated with PNS-activated BDNF/TrkB signalling and inactivation of p75NTR expression, providing a novel potential therapy for alleviating HI injury.",
