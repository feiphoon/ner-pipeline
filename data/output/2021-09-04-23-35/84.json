    "abstract": "Korean red ginseng (KRG), a processed product of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, show significant anti-depressive effect in clinic. However, its mechanism is still unclear.\nGap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) dysfunction is a potential pathogenesis of depression. Therefore, this study's objective is to investigate whether the antidepressant effect of KRG is related to GJIC.\nRat were restraint 8\u00a0h every day for 28 consecutive days to prepare depression models, and meanwhile, rats were intragastrically administrated with normal saline, KRG solutions (25, 50 or 100\u00a0mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10\u00a0mg/kg) 1\u00a0h before stress. The behavioral performance was determined by forced swimming test, sucrose preference test and open field test. GJIC was determined by the Lucifer yellow (LY) diffusion distance in prelimb cortex (PLC). In addition, the level of Cx43, one of executors of GJIC, was tested by Western blot. To find out the protective effect of KRG against GJIC dysfunction directly, rats were intracranially injected with carbenoxolone (CBX, blocker of GJIC), and meanwhile normal saline, KRG (100\u00a0mg/kg) or fluoxetine (10\u00a0mg/kg) was administered daily. The behavioral performance of these rats was detected, and the LY localization injection PLC area was used to detect the gap junction function.\nChronic resistant stress (CRS) induced depressive symptoms, as manifested by prolonged immobility time in forced swimming test and decreased sucrose consumption ratio. Administration of KRG alleviated these depressive symptoms significantly. GJIC determination showed that KRG improved the LY diffusion and increased Cx43 level in prefrontal cortex (PFC) significantly, indicated that GJIC dysfunction was alleviated by the treatment of KRG. However, the astrocytes number was also increased by the treatment of KRG, which maybe alleviate depression-like symptoms by increasing the number of astrocytes rather than improving GJIC. Injection of CBX produced depressive symptoms and GJIC dysfunction, as manifested by decreased sucrose consumption ratio and prolonged immobility time in forced swimming test, but no astrocytes number changes, KRG also reversed depressive symptoms and GJIC dysfunction, suggested that the improvement of depressive-like symptoms was improved by GJIC.\nKRG alleviate depressive disorder by improving astrocytic gap junction function.",
