    "abstract": "Irreversible loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a common pathological feature of various optic nerve degenerative diseases such as glaucoma and ischemic optic neuropathy. Effective protection of RGCs is the key to successful treatment of these diseases. Total Panax notoginseng saponins (TPNS) are the main active component of Panax notoginseng, which has an inhibitory effect on the apoptosis pathway. This study is aimed at assessing the protective effect of TPNS on RGCs of the optic nerve crush (ONC) model of rats and exploring the underlying mechanisms. The intraperitoneal or intravitreal injection of TPNS was used based on the establishment of the rat ONC model. Fifteen days after the injury, the cell membrane fluorescent probe (Fluoro-Gold) was applied to retrograde RGCs through the superior colliculus and obtain the number of surviving RGCs. TUNEL assay was also used to detect the number and density of RGC apoptosis after the ONC model. The expression and distribution of Bcl-2/Bax, c-Jun/P-c-Jun, and P-JNK in the retina were demonstrated by Western blot analysis. After the intervention of TPNS, the rate of cell survival increased in different retinal regions (",
