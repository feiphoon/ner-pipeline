    "abstract": "Increased de novo lipogenesis creates excess intrahepatic fat and lipotoxins, propagating liver damage in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. TVB-2640, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, was designed to reduce excess liver fat and directly inhibit inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways. We assessed the safety and efficacy of TVB-2640 in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the United States.\n3V2640-CLIN-005 (FASCINATE-1) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study at 10 US sites. Adults with \u22658% liver fat, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction, and evidence of liver fibrosis by magnetic resonance elastography \u22652.5 kPa or liver biopsy were eligible. Ninety-nine patients were randomized to receive placebo or 25 mg or 50 mg of TVB-2640 (orally, once-daily for 12 weeks). The primary end points of this study were safety and relative change in liver fat after treatment.\nLiver fat increased in the placebo cohort by 4.5% relative to baseline; in contrast TVB-2640 reduced liver fat by 9.6% in the 25-mg cohort (n\u00a0= 30; least squares mean: -15.5%; 95% confidence interval, -31.3 to -0.23; P\u00a0= .053), and 28.1% in the 50-mg cohort (n\u00a0= 28; least squares mean: -28.0%; 95% confidence interval, -44.5 to -11.6; P\u00a0= .001). Eleven percent of patients in the placebo group achieved a \u226530% relative reduction of liver fat compared to 23% in the 25-mg group, and 61% in the 50-mg group (P < .001). Secondary analyses showed improvements of metabolic, pro-inflammatory and fibrotic markers. TVB-2640 was well tolerated; adverse events were mostly mild and balanced among the groups.\nTVB-2640 significantly reduced liver fat and improved biochemical, inflammatory, and fibrotic biomarkers after 12 weeks, in a dose-dependent manner in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
