    "abstract": "As an important component of ginseng, the in vivo benefits of ginseng water-soluble dietary fiber (ginseng-SDF) have not been fully revealed. To explore these benefits, healthy rats were given ginseng-SDF (200, 400, and 800\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day) by gavage for 15\u00a0days. The results showed that ginseng-SDF significantly improved the rats' growth performance and serum antioxidant status. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1 and IGF-2) and immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, and IgG) levels in the ginseng-SDF groups were increased. High-dose ginseng-SDF significantly increased the cecal butyric acid proportion compared with the K group. Ginseng-SDF increased the abundance of Firmicutes and promoted the proliferation of probiotics such as Lactobacillus, and cellulose decomposers such as Ruminococcus and Clostridium in cecal microflora. These altered microflora were correlated with growth performance, antioxidant status and immunoglobulin indexes. The above results suggested that ginseng-SDF might have positive effects on growth, oxidative-immune levels and cecal health in rats.",
