However, it is expensive to produce and can therefore be easily adulterated with cheaper oils to improve the profit margins. Spectroscopic methods are becoming more and more common in food fraud detection. The aim of this study was to answer following questions: Is it possible to detect chia oil adulteration by spectroscopic analysis of the oils? Is it possible to identify the adulteration oil? Is it possible to determine the amount of adulteration? Two chia oils from local markets were adulterated with three common food oils, including sunflower, rapeseed and corn oil. Subsequently, six chia oils obtained from different sites in Kenya were adulterated with sunflower oil to check the results. Raman, NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy were applied for the analysis. It was possible to detect the amount of adulterated oils by spectroscopic analysis, with a minimum R<sup>2</sup> of 0.95 for the used partial least square regression with a maximum RMSEP<sub>range</sub> of 10%. The adulterations of chia oils by rapeseed, sunflower and corn oil were identified by classification with a median true positive rate of 90%. The training accuracies, sensitivity and specificity of the classifications were over 90%. Chia oil B was easier to detect. The adulterated samples were identified with a precision of 97%. All of the classification methods show good results, however SVM were the best. The identification of the adulteration oil was possible; less than 5% of the adulteration oils were difficult to detect. In summary, spectroscopic analysis of chia oils might be a useful tool to identify adulterations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Bioresources Technology, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, Private Bag, Dedan Kimathi, Nyeri 10143, Kenya."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-6772-7296"], "LastName": "Mburu", "ForeName": "Monica", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Food Bioresources Technology, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, Private Bag, Dedan Kimathi, Nyeri 10143, Kenya."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Komu", "ForeName": "Clement", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Analytics and Cereal Science, Institute of Food Science and Biotechnology, University of Hohenheim, Garbenstr. 23, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paquet-Durand", "ForeName": "Olivier", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Analytics and Cereal Science, Institute of Food Science and Biotechnology, University of Hohenheim, Garbenstr. 23, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": ["0000-0001-7762-7977"], "LastName": "Hitzmann", "ForeName": "Bernd", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Process Analytics and Cereal Science, Institute of Food Science and Biotechnology, University of Hohenheim, Garbenstr. 23, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zettel", "ForeName": "Viktoria", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Research Stays for University Academics and Scientists, 2019 (57440915)", "Agency": "Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Foods", "NlmUniqueID": "101670569", "ISSNLinking": "2304-8158"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J AOAC Int. 2000 Nov-Dec;83(6):1435-9", "ArticleIdList": ["11128149"]}, {"Citation": "Food Chem. 2017 Feb 15;217:735-742", "ArticleIdList": ["27664692"]}, {"Citation": "J Sci Food Agric. 2019 Mar 30;99(5):2285-2291", "ArticleIdList": ["30324617"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2009 Jul 22;57(14):6001-6", "ArticleIdList": ["19537730"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2005 Sep 7;53(18):6988-94", "ArticleIdList": ["16131100"]}, {"Citation": "Food Chem. 2015 Aug 15;181:25-30", "ArticleIdList": ["25794716"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Chem. 2016 Apr 19;88(8):4516-24", "ArticleIdList": ["26971405"]}, {"Citation": "Talanta. 2016 Dec 1;161:80-86", "ArticleIdList": ["27769485"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Chim Acta. 2017 Apr 8;961:42-48", "ArticleIdList": ["28224907"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 2005 Feb 9;53(3):759-66", "ArticleIdList": ["15686431"]}, {"Citation": "Circulation. 2005 Nov 22;112(21):3232-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16301356"]}, {"Citation": "Br Poult Sci. 2011 Dec;52(6):750-60", "ArticleIdList": ["22221241"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "06", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "07", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "08", "Day": "03"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34441575", "foods10081798", "10.3390/foods10081798", "PMC8392156"]}}]}
