This study investigated the effect of an oak bark decoction (OBD) and isolated tannin fractions on the degranulation capacity and cytokine/chemokine release from rat basophilic cells and human mast cells in vitro, which are essential for the initiation of early- and late-phase allergic reactions.", "By chromatographic separation on Sephadex<sup>\u00ae</sup> LH-20 high- and low-molecular weight tannins were separated from OBD and the tannin composition analyzed by HPLC(DAD)-MS<sup>n</sup>. Then, the OBD and its fractions were tested in degranulation (\u03b2-hexosaminidase activity) of allergen-specific-activated basophilic cells in a photometric assay.", "The OBD and the high-molecular tannin fraction showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell degranulation. Furthermore, the OBD and particularly its high molecular weight tannin fraction exhibited an inhibitory activity on the IL-8-, IL-6- and TNF-\u03b1-secretion from stimulated human mast cells, detected and quantified by ELISA.", "The OBD and its high-molecular weight tannins revealed an impact on allergic mediator release of basophilic cells and human mast cells and thereby provide a rationale for the topical treatment with OBD preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
