We tested tyrosinase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of Q. coccifera bark extract and isolated compounds from it. The extract inhibited tyrosinase with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 75.13\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.44\u202f\u00b5g/mL. Among the isolated compounds, polydatin (6) showed potent tyrosinase inhibition compared to the positive control, kojic acid, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.30\u202f\u00b5g/mL. The Q. coccifera extract also inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase significantly with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08\u202f\u00b5g/mL. (-)-8-Chlorocatechin (5) was the most potent isolate, also more potent than the positive control, acarbose, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 43.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.67\u202f\u00b5g/mL. According to the kinetic analysis, 6 was a noncompetitive and 5 was a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, and 5 was a noncompetitive \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. In the light of these findings, we performed in silico molecular docking studies for 5 and 6 with QM/MM optimizations to predict their tyrosinase inhibition mechanisms at molecular level and search for correlations with the in vitro results. We found that the ionized form of 5 (5i) showed higher affinity and more stable binding to tyrosinase catalytic site than its neutral form, while 6 bound to the predicted allosteric sites of the enzyme better than the catalytic site."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
