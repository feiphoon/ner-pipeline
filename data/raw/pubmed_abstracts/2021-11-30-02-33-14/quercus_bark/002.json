This research was undertaken to examine accumulation capacities of macroelements (Ca, K, Mg, Na) and trace metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in needles and bark of Pinus sylvestris and leaves and bark of Quercus petraea growing in the vicinity of the chlor-alkali plant PCC Rokita in Brzeg Dolny (Lower Silesia, SW Poland). Because Scots pine is well studied and considered a useful bioindicator, we have used this species as a base for comparison of the accumulation ability of sessile oak that shows some features of good bioindicator, but whose biogeochemistry was scarcely studied. Results showed that for both species leaves contained more macroelements (Ca, K, Mg), whereas the bark was richer in most trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Pb). However, trees studied differed with respect to element content. Oak bark and leaves were more effective in accumulating macro- and trace elements (bark Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and leaves Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Ni) than Scots pine tissues. Nevertheless, foliar metal accumulation index of these species was similar, suggesting that their overall ability to accumulate trace metals was similar."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Biogeochemistry and Environmental Protection, University of Wroc\u0142aw, ul.
