The influence of Ca(2+) (0.2-3.7 millimolar) and Al(3+) (0-3.7 millimolar) on the permeability of root cortical cells of Quercus rubra was measured using three nonelectrolytes (urea, methyl urea, and ethyl urea) as permeators of progressively increasing lipid solubility. Water permeability was also measured. Al(3+) (a) increased membrane permeability to the nonelectrolytes, (b) decreased the membrane's partiality for lipid permeators, and (c) decreased membrane permeability to water. Ca(2+) had effects on permeability that were opposite to those of Al(3+). When Al(3+) and Ca(2+) were tested in combination, these opposite effects counteracted each other. The results suggest that Al(3+) altered the architecture of membrane lipids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Nankai University, Tianjin, Peoples Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "X J", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sucoff", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stadelmann", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Jul;64(1):131-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16660901"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1978 Sep 14;84(1):138-43", "ArticleIdList": ["215137"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16665194", "10.1104/pp.83.1.159", "PMC1056316"]}}]}
