Three types of activity and their combinations were revealed: (i) direct antimicrobial growth-inhibitory activity, (ii) non-specific and specific pro-QS activities, (iii) anti-QS activity. Among seven plant extracts showing direct growth-inhibitory activity, the strongest effect was shown by Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry) leaves. Many plants stimulated violacein production by wild-type C. violaceum ATCC 31532 in a non-specific manner, and only the herb Bidens tripartita (three-lobe beggarticks) contained compounds that mimic acyl-homoserine lactone and operated as a QS agonist. Anti-QS activity was found in eleven plants including Quercus robur (oak) cortex, Betula verrucosa (birch) buds and Eucalyptus viminalis (Manna Gum) leaves. Subsequent statistical analysis showed differences between antimicrobial and anti-QS activities, whereas both activities were defined by phylogenetic position of medical resource plant. Finally, extract from Quercus robur cortex revealed at least two fractions, showing different anti-QS mechanisms. These data confirm that multicomponent anti-infectious mechanisms are used by plants, which may be useful for drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tolmacheva", "ForeName": "Anna A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rogozhin", "ForeName": "Eugene A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deryabin", "ForeName": "Dmitry G", "Initials": "DG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "9303678", "ISSNLinking": "1330-0075"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJH0DSQ3SG", "NameOfSubstance": "violacein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chromobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Quorum Sensing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "02", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24914718", "10.2478/acph-2014-0019", "/j/acph.2014.64.issue-2/acph-2014-0019/acph-2014-0019.xml"]}}]}
