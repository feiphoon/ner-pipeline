Despite the high impact of proanthocyanidins, these polyphenols are mostly quantified by colorimetric methods or by chromatographic determination of the flavan-3-ols as cleavage products or low molecular oligomers as lead compounds. For St. John's wort (Hyperici herba) from Hypericum perforatum, a protocol for preparative isolation of oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins from an acetone-water extract by chromatography on Sephadex\u00aeLH20 in combination with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography on the diol stationary phase was developed, yielding procyanidin reference clusters with a defined degree of polymerization from 3 to 10. Identity and purity of these clusters was proven by high-performance liquid chromatography (RP18 and diol phase) and mass spectrometry. For identification and quantification of proanthocyanidin clusters from St. John's wort, an ICH-Q2 (International harmonized guideline for analytical validation) validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorimetric detection was developed using an acetone-water extract of the herbal material, purified by solid-phase extraction for the removal of naphthodianthrones. The method enabled the quantification of procyanidin clusters with a degree of polymerization from 2 to 10. Analysis of nine batches of Hyperici herba from different sources indicated a high variability of proanthocyanidin content in the range from 8 to 37\u2009mg/g. In all of the batches investigated, the trimer cluster DP3 was the dominant proanthocyanidin (about 40\u200a%), followed by DP 4 (about 15\u200a%) and DP5 (about 12\u200a%). Monitoring of procyanidin distribution during seasonal growth of fresh plants of H. perforatum indicated the highest proanthocyanidin content in young plants (about 50\u2009mg/g) and a time-dependent decrease during the growing season to about 16\u2009mg/g. The highest proanthocyanidin content was found in young leaves and flowers, while the fruits were proanthocyanidin-free; older parts of the stem and the herb had a lower proanthocyanidin content. From these data, it can be concluded that proanthocyanidins serve as part of the plant defense system in the reproductive organs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hellenbrand", "ForeName": "Nils", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Lechtenberg", "ForeName": "Matthias", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Petereit", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sendker", "ForeName": "Jandirk", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hensel", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biflavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4852-22-6", "NameOfSubstance": "procyanidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Biflavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Proanthocyanidins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25905592", "10.1055/s-0035-1545916"]}}]}
