Herein, we present the first successful preparation of a new family of daisy chain dendrimers, in which the individual [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units serve as the branches of dendrimer skeleton. In particular, the third-generation daisy chain dendrimer with 21 [c2]daisy chain rotaxane moieties was realized, which might be among the most complicated discrete high-order MIMs comprised of multiple [c2]daisy chain rotaxane units. Interestingly, such unique topological arrangements of multiple stimuli-responsive [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes endowed the resultant daisy chain dendrimers controllable and reversible nanoscale dimension modulation through the collective and amplified extension/contraction of each [c2]daisy chain rotaxane branch upon the addition of acetate anions or DMSO molecules as external stimulus. Furthermore, on the basis of such an intriguing size switching feature of daisy chain dendrimers, dynamic composite polymer films were constructed through the incorporation of daisy chain dendrimers into polymer films, which could undergo fast, reversible, and controllable shape transformations when DMSO molecules were employed as stimulus. The successful merging of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes and dendrimers described herein provides not only a brand-new type of high-order mechanically interlocked systems with well-defined topological arrangements of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes, but also a successful and practical approach toward the construction of supramolecular dynamic materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
