Their structures were elucidated by extensive analysis of spectroscopic data (1D, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS) and Mosher's method. The absolute configurations of 1, 2, and 4 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cardioprotective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cardiomyocytes injury, and compound 5 showed statistically significant cardioprotective effect in vitro assays.", "article_date": "20200615", "date_completed": "20210322", "date_revised": "20210322"}
