Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of the undescribed compounds were determined by the ECD data and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Hispanins B and C represented the first neo-clerodane diterpenoids with a unique oxygen bridge between C-19 and C-20. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Five of these compounds showed significant cardioprotective effects.", "article_date": "20190727", "date_completed": "20190924", "date_revised": "20190925"}
