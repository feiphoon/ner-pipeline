It affects 12% of the population worldwide. Salvia hispanica seeds are rich source of quercetin which has preventive role in renal stone formation. The study objective was to explore scientifically the anti-urolithiatic effect of Salvia hispanica seed's methanol extract using in vitro and in vivo urolithiasis models. For in-vitro study nucleation, growth and aggregation assays were performed. In vivo study was performed on rats and they were divided into six groups (n=6). Group-I was given vehicle only. Group-II was disease control, treated with 0.75% EG in drinking water which triggered urolithiasis. Groups-III received cystone (750 mg/kg, orally). Groups IV-VI were treated with extract at 100, 300 and 700 mg/kg doses orally once daily. Groups III-VI additionally received 0.75% EG in drinking water. In vitro study revealed concentration dependent increase in percentage inhibition of crystal's nucleation, growth and aggregation. In vivo study revealed anti-urolithiatic activity by lowering oxalate, calcium, phosphate, sodium and potassium levels in the urine and the serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, total proteins and total albumin. Salvia hispanica seeds are good alterative of allopathic anti-urolithiatic drugs to treat urolithiasis.", "article_date": "20201116", "date_completed": "20201120", "date_revised": "20210308"}
