Water deficit is one of the abiotic factors that most limit germination for compromising the sequence of metabolic events that culminate with seedling emergence. Several attenuating substances have been used to mitigate the effects resulting from this stress and give higher tolerance to the species. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the action of different agents as water stress attenuators in the germination and accumulation of organic compounds in S. hispanica seedlings. The treatments consisted of pre-soaking the seeds for 4 hours in salicylic acid (1 mM.L-1), gibberellic acid (0.4 mM.L-1), distilled water and control treatment (without soaking). The seeds were germinated at osmotic potentials of 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3 and -0.4 MPa, using PEG 6000 as an osmotic agent. The variables germination percentage, germination speed index, shoot and primary root lengths, total dry mass, proline, total soluble sugars and total free amino acids were analyzed. Salicylic acid and gibberellic acid led to the best results among the attenuators tested, increasing germination, length, dry mass and biochemical components of S. hispanica seedlings under water deficit. Therefore, salicylic and gibberellic acids are efficient in mitigating water stress in S. hispanica seeds up to the potential of -0.4 MPa.", "article_date": "20210604", "date_completed": "20210610", "date_revised": "20210610"}
