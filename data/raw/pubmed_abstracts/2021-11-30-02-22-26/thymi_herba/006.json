The contents of analyzed compounds in the studied hydrophilic extracts, prepared form herbal sources, were established using a C18 column with acetonitrile-water-formic acid as a mobile phase. The HPLC method was validated for linearity, precision and accuracy. Luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucuronide and lithospermic acid were identified as new wild thyme constituents, luteolin-7-O-\u03b2-glucuronide and methyl rosmarinate as new compounds in sweet marjoram. Methyl rosmarinate was isolated for the first time from thyme. The investigated herbal drugs and spices provide polyphenols in high amounts, even up to 84.3mg per 1g of a dried herb.
