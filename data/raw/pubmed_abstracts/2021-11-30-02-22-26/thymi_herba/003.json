Rectal swabs were collected weekly and were sent in for bacterial testing. The shedding of haemolysing E. coli was evaluated. There was no significant difference in the shedding of haemolysing E. coli between the 4 groups. Neither was there a difference in the distribution of the various serotypes. Thymol was detected in the blood plasma in all thyme groups. The increase in thymol level with greater amounts of thyme herb was significant. Three days after withdrawal of the feed additive no thymol levels were detected. The study results did not reveal any effects on haemolysing E. coli in the gut."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Organic Agriculture and Biodiversity of Large Animals, Agricultural Research and Education Centre Raumberg-Gumpenstein, Wels, Austria. werner.hagmueller@raumberg-gumpenstein.at"}], "LastName": "Hagm\u00fcller", "ForeName": "Werner", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jugl-Chizzola", "ForeName": "Martina", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zitterl-Eglseer", "ForeName": "Karin", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabler", "ForeName": "Cornelia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spergser", "ForeName": "Joachim", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chizzola", "ForeName": "Remigius", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Franz", "ForeName": "Chlodwig", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr", "NlmUniqueID": "0003163", "ISSNLinking": "0005-9366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Swine Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16450709"]}}]}
