Sixty adult Wistar rats (210-225\u2009g) were divided into Ten groups (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096). Group 1: received normal saline orally (NC), group 2, 3, 4 and 5 rats were respectively received 100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg of TE and Vitamin C (25\u2009mg/kg) orally; group 6 rats received normal saline orally and 150\u2009mg/kg of 5-FLU via <i>i.p</i>., on the last day; rats in group 7, 8, 9 and 10 were orally pretreated with 100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg of TE and Vit C (25\u2009mg/kg) respectively, and administered with 150\u2009mg/kg of 5-FLU <i>i.p.,</i> on the last day. The purine [adenosine 5'-tri- and di-phosphatases (ATPase and ADPase), adenosine deaminase (ADA)] nucleotide and acetylcholine hydrolyzing [acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butrylcholinesterase (BChE)] enzymes as well as arginase activities and antioxidant status were assessed. The result revealed that untreated 5-FLU rats had increased enzyme activities, which was reduced in the normal rats treated TE compared to NC. Interestingly, the TE-pretreated rats administered with 5-FLU had reduced enzyme activities compared with untreated 5-FLU rats. The antioxidant status was also normalized in the 5-FLU administered rats pretreated with TE Thus, the neuroprotective mechanisms of TE could be linked to attenuation of neuroactive enzymes and antioxidant status."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1339-403X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Food and Nutraceutical Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adefegha", "ForeName": "Stephen Adeniyi", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Food and Nutraceutical Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Technology, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oyeleye", "ForeName": "Sunday Idowu", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Food and Nutraceutical Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akintemi", "ForeName": "Abimbola", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Food and Nutraceutical Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Okeke", "ForeName": "Bathlomew Maduka", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Food and Nutraceutical Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oboh", "ForeName": "Ganiyu", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U3P01618RT", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorouracil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorouracil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31475590", "10.1080/01480545.2019.1659310"]}}]}
