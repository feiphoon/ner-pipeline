The total of 2,166 participating patients, all suffering from mild to moderate depression, were prescribed to take 600 mg (one tablet) or 1,200 mg (two tablets) daily. Four-hundred-forty-six general practitioners, psychiatrists and neurologists conducted the survey. Three quarters of the participating patients were female at an average age of 50 years. Most of the patients suffered from a depression which was diagnosed for the first time. Approximately in one third of the patients, a recurrent depression was diagnosed.", "The average severity of the depression was \"moderate\" (basing on CGI; Clinical Global Impression Scale) at the beginning of the survey and was reduced to less than \"mild\" after an average observation time of seven weeks. 83.7% patients (600 mg) and 88.6% (1,200 mg) responded respectively. During this observation period, an improvement in symptoms, measured in 17 items, was of clinical relevance. The treating physicians described the drug tolerance as being good or very good for 99% in all cases. This observation was confirmed by adverse drug reactions, which amounted to 0.41%. The low ratio of adverse drug reactions of 0.41% confirmed the physicians' judgement.", "The results obtained from this observational study were similar to those of an equally designed observation performed in 1998, where St. John's wort was observed in a dosage of 300 mg per tablet (standard dosage 3 x 300 mg/d). This is a good proof of the effectiveness and the tolerability of this drug in patients who are suffering from mild and moderate depressive episodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH, Karlsruhe."}], "LastName": "Rychlik", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Siedentop", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "von den Driesch", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kasper", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study"], "VernacularTitle": "Johanniskrautextrakt WS 5572 bei leichten bis mittelschweren Depressionen.
