As a common plant found around the world, Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae) is traditionally prepared as an oily extract and used as a folk remedy for various diseases such as wounds, burns, cuts, etc. This study aims to evaluate the effect of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) on problematic wounds while comparing oral and topical applications.", "Incisional and excisional wound models were made on the dorsal regions of 54 diabetic Spraque-Dawley rats. The rats were divided into the following six groups (n = 9): Group 1: control, Group 2: diabetic, Group 3: diabetic oral Hypericum perforatum, Group 4: diabetic topical Hypericum perforatum, Group 5: diabetic oral olive oil, and Group 6: diabetic topical olive oil.", "Groups 3 and 4 had significantly higher tensile strength, tissue hydroxyproline concentration, and collagen density compared with Group 2. Inflammatory cell density and collagen density on day 3 were significantly higher in Groups 3 and 6 compared with Group 2. On day 21, Groups 3 and 6 had significantly higher fibroblastic activity compared with Group 2.", "This study has proved that oral St. John's wort has more positive effects on problematic wounds compared with topical St. John's wort and olive oil, which is a vehicle. Hypericum perforatum results with faster inflammatory response and better healing. These results could be an addition to literature about the clinical usage of Hypericum perforatum on diabetic wounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9971-7137"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Mu\u011fla Sitki Ko\u00e7man University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Mu\u011fla , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Alt\u0131parmak", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Erciyes University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery , Kayseri , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Eskita\u015f\u00e7\u0131o\u011flu", "ForeName": "Teoman", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Invest Surg", "NlmUniqueID": "8809255", "ISSNLinking": "0894-1939"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Olive Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Olive Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Wound"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28107097", "10.1080/08941939.2016.1272654"]}}]}
