Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including HRESIMS, IR, UV, and NMR (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY, and NOESY experiments). Their absolute configurations were determined by comprehensive analyses of their experimental ECD spectra in conjunction with a modified Mosher's method. Evaluation of their neuroprotective activities highlighted hyperforatin L, which displayed mild activity at a concentration of 10\u202f\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
