Naphthodianthrones, phloroglucinols and flavonoids are the most widely analysed metabolites of this plant. For routine quality control, detection of major compounds belonging to these groups seems to be sufficient; however, closer characterization requires the detection of minor compounds as well.", "TLC and HPTLC are basic methods in the routine analysis, whereas HPLC-DAD is the most widely applied method for quantitative analysis due to its versatility. LC-MS is gaining importance in pharmacokinetic studies due to its sensitivity. Modern approaches, such as DNA barcoding, NIRS and NMR metabolomics, may offer new possibilities for the more detailed characterization of secondary metabolite profile of H. perforatum extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Royal Pharmaceutical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Cluster \"Biodiversity and Medicines\" , Research Group \"Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy\" , UCL School of Pharmacy , University of London, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Agapouda", "ForeName": "Anastasia", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Cluster \"Biodiversity and Medicines\" , Research Group \"Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy\" , UCL School of Pharmacy , University of London, London, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Herbal and East Asian Medicine, Department of Life Sciences, University of Westminster, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre of Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Kiss", "ForeName": "Tivadar", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre of Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Hohmann", "ForeName": "Judit", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Cluster \"Biodiversity and Medicines\" , Research Group \"Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy\" , UCL School of Pharmacy , University of London, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Heinrich", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Centre of Natural Products, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary."}], "LastName": "Csupor", "ForeName": "Dezs\u0151", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00012", "Agency": "J\u00e1nos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "08"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "01", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28266019", "10.1111/jphp.12711"]}}]}
