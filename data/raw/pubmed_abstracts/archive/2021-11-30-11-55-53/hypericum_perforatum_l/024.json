The main strategy is to combine the traditional perspective of using medicinal oils with polymeric scaffolds manufactured by an engineering approach to fabricate a potential tissue engineering product that provides both new tissue formation and wound healing. The scaffolds manufactured by cryogelation were soft, spongy, highly porous, physically stable, elastic and could be easily cut in any desired shape. Physicochemical, mechanical and morphological analyzes were used to characterize the produced cryogels. Young modulus of the plain chitosan cryogel was about 21\u202fkPa whereas it increased with increasing HP oil content and became 61\u202fkPa for 20% HP oil ratio. Further, the antimicrobial studies, antioxidant and DNA cleavage effects were investigated. Samples including the highest ratio of oil (CS4) showed the highest DPPH scavenging activity as 69.9%. In addition, 20% HP oil loaded chitosan cryogel demonstrated single strain DNA cleavage activitiy at 500\u202f\u03bcg/mL concentration. Antimicrobial studies were applied against seven strains. The lowest activities were obtained against E. hirae and B. cereus, the highest against E. coli and L. pneumophila. This study concluded that the newly developed HP oil loaded chitosan cryogel scaffolds with unique antimicrobial and antioxidant properties are promising candidates to be used in tissue engineering applications as wound dressing for exudative and long-term healing wounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
