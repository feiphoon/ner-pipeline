Neurodegeneration is associated with elevated levels of MAO-B that can lead to damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. The current study, evaluated the effects of asiaticoside-D (AD) from neuroprotective CA, on the levels and activities of monoamine oxidase A and B (MAO-A and B), in addition to the behavioral analysis.", "Qualitative and quantitative analyses of various solvent extracts of CA were performed. The extracts were screened for antioxidant potential using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydroxyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiozoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) radical, nitric oxide (NO) radical inhibition, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The purification of AD was done by column, thin layer and high-performance liquid chromatographies followed by structural elucidation using IR, HR-MS, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra. Docking studies were performed to assess the impact of AD on MAO-A and B.In vivo, Lumbricus terrestris were exposed to 0.4\u202fppm rotenone (ROT) of medium for 7 days and were subjected to co-treatment along with 15\u202fppm of AD from CA. At the end of experiment period, the neuronal behavior of worms was assessed. Cerebral ganglions (CGs) were removed and the m-RNA levels of MAO-A and B were analyzed by Semi Q-PCR and their activities were also analyzed.", "The ethanolic extracts exhibited higher antiradical activity against DPPH, ABTS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, LPO, FRAP, NO and vitamin C with EC<sub>50</sub> value of 20.2, 20.9, 20.4, 22.0, 24.9, 28.1, 25.5 and 22.0\u202f\u00b5g/ml respectively. Structural analysis by IR, HR-MS, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum have shown the structure of the isolated compound as (2\u03b1, 3\u03b2)-2,3-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oicacid-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21924)-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl (1\u21926)-\u03b2-copyranosyl ester and was represented as AD. In silico interaction of AD with MAO-A and B residues Lys312 at distances of 1.84\u202f\u00c5 and 2.44\u202f\u00c5 respectively was found to exhibit high binding energy of -9.4 and 7.4\u202fkcal. The neuronal behavior using L. terrestris showed significant improvement against (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) ROT impaired behavior (group II) on AD supplementation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Further, the m-RNA levels and activities of MAO-A and B which were significantly altered (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) by ROT could be effectively maintained on AD supplementation.", "AD was found to exert its negative impact on the levels and activities of MAO-A and B in CGs of rotenone- induced changes in L. terrestris, the property which is considered to be crucial against ROT induced neurodegenerative pathology like -Parkinsonism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
