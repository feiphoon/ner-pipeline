In this study, pentacyclic triterpene-rich centella extract (PRE) was combined with Eudragit\u00ae EPO as a hydrophilic polymer using solvent evaporation to produce a solid dispersion (PRE-ESD). The optimum PRE/Eudragit ratio of 1:2 enhanced the solubility and dissolution of glycosides (AS >\u20093.5 folds, MS >\u20092 folds) and aglycones (AA >\u200965 folds and MA >\u200956 folds) in 0.1\u00a0N hydrochloric acid (pH\u00a01.2). DSC, XRD, and FT-IR analysis showed that the four pentacyclic triterpenes in PRE existed in the amorphous state in the solid dispersion. Moreover, almost 100% of the compounds were released from the solid dispersion within 2\u00a0h. The effects of PRE-ESD on cell proliferation and wound healing in vitro were investigated in human gastric epithelial cell lines (AGS cells). Exposure to PRE-ESD (equivalent to PRE concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) promoted cell proliferation and enhanced 'wound closure' in the scratch assay of wound healing by 82% compared with non-treated groups. Unformulated MA and AA aglycones did not exhibit a wound healing effect. Moreover, PRE-ESD was found to accelerate wound closure compared with either AS or MS, indicating that the wound healing properties of PRE-ESD are conferred by the active compounds AS and MS that are presented in PRE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Excellence Research Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wannasarit", "ForeName": "Saowanee", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Excellence Research Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Puttarak", "ForeName": "Panupong", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Excellence Research Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Kaewkroek", "ForeName": "Kanidta", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand. ruedeekorn.w@psu.ac.th."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Excellence Research Center, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90112, Thailand. ruedeekorn.w@psu.ac.th."}], "LastName": "Wiwattanapatapee", "ForeName": "Ruedeekorn", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "AAPS PharmSciTech", "NlmUniqueID": "100960111", "ISSNLinking": "1530-9932"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "04", "Day": "02"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "07", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31396788", "10.1208/s12249-019-1488-7", "10.1208/s12249-019-1488-7"]}}]}
