PCR amplification was conducted to determine the presence of s-ltb gene in the transgenic centella plant. The expression of s-ltb gene was analyzed by immunoblotting and quantified by ELISA. In vitro activity of LTB protein was determined by GM1-ELISA.", "PCR amplification has found seven transgenic centella individuals. However, only five of them produced LTB protein. ELISA analysis showed that the highest amount of LTB protein detected in transgenic centella leaves was about 0.8% of the total soluble protein. GM1-ELISA assay indicated that plant LTB protein bound specifically to GM1-ganglioside, suggesting that the LTB subunits formed active pentamers.", "The s-ltb gene that was successfully transformed into centella plants by the biolistic method has produced a relatively high amount of plant LTB protein in the pentameric quaternary structure that has GM1-ganglioside binding affinity, a receptor on the intestinal epithelial membrane."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioactive Compounds and Department of Biotechnology, University of Sciences, Hue University, Hue, Thua Thien Hue 530000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Loc", "ForeName": "Nguyen H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioactive Compounds and Department of Biotechnology, University of Sciences, Hue University, Hue, Thua Thien Hue 530000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Tung", "ForeName": "Nghiem V", "Initials": "NV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioactive Compounds and Department of Biotechnology, University of Sciences, Hue University, Hue, Thua Thien Hue 530000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Phan T A", "Initials": "PTA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences and Research Center of Bioactive Materials, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Chonbuk 561-756, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Moon S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Centella asiatica extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enterotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "heat-labile enterotoxin, E coli"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biolistics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enterotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "09", "Day": "02"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "01", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32101119", "CPB-EPUB-104838", "10.2174/1389201021666200226094150"]}}]}
