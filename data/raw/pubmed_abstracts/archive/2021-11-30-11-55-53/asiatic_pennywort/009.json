CA has CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes inhibition property and used as an adjuvant therapy with conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). That may be responsible for herb-drug interaction.", "The present study was planned to evaluate interactions profile of hydroalcoholic extract Centella asiatica (HECA) with antiepileptic drugs in experimental models of epilepsy in rats.", "Wistar rats (175-200\u00a0g) were used. In the pharmacodynamic interaction study, seizures were induced using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (60\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) (70\u00a0mA for 0.2\u00a0s). The therapeutic and sub-therapeutic doses of valproate (VPA) and phenytoin (PHT) were co-administrated with HECA in PTZ and MES model of seizures respectively. Behavioural parameters were assessed using elevated plus maze test and passive avoidance paradigm. Rat brain oxidative stress parameters were also assessed. In the pharmacokinetic interaction study, the serum levels of the VPA and PHT were estimated at different time intervals by HPLC and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by WinNonlin software.", "The VPA and PHT produced complete protection against seizures in their therapeutic doses but not with sub-therapeutic doses. However, co-administration of HECA with a sub-therapeutic dose of VPA and PHT enhanced the protection of seizures and significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) attenuated the seizure induced oxidative stress and cognitive impairment. It also significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) serum levels of VPA and PHT. The alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum serum concentration, area under the curve, clearance) of AEDs were also found with co-administration of HECA.", "The results suggested that co-administration of HECA could improve the therapeutic efficacy of VPA and PHT. But, alteration in pharmacokinetic parameters revel that needs critical medical supervision to avoid any toxic reactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
