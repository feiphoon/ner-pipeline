Current treatment has several adverse effects and can be ineffective once the pain is initiated. <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> traditionally used for pain management was investigated in this study for its activity on uterine contraction in the nonpregnant uterus, as a parameter for dysmenorrhea. The dried leaves of <i>T. vulgaris</i> were macerated in water, and the resulting aqueous extract was investigated on the isolated mouse uterus. Parameters investigated included spontaneous contractions, oxytocin-induced contractions, and high potassium chloride (KCl; 80\u2009mM)-induced tonic contractions. Mass spectrometric analysis of the thyme extract was also performed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution Fourier Transform mass spectrometry. Thyme extract inhibited the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine contractions. It also inhibited KCl-induced tonic contractions. The activities observed suggest that <i>T. vulgaris</i> inhibits uterine contractions through blockade of extracellular voltage-gated calcium channels. Secondary metabolites detected included compounds belonging to chlorogenic phytochemical class and flavonoids, which are known to have activities on extracellular calcium blockade. This study has shown that aqueous <i>T. vulgaris</i> extract, also known as thyme, inhibits contractions of the nonpregnant uterus and can be a lead plant in the drug discovery process for the management of dysmenorrhea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Bafor", "ForeName": "Enitome E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science and Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Science, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Kalu", "ForeName": "Chioma H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Omoruyi", "ForeName": "Osemelomen", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science and Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Science, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Elvis-Offiah", "ForeName": "Uloma B", "Initials": "UB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Edrada-Ebel", "ForeName": "RuAngelie", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32758061", "10.1089/jmf.2020.0076"]}}]}
