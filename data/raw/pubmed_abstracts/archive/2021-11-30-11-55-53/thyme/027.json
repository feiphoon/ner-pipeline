The accumulated release rates of thyme oil and microcapsules at 4\u00a0\u00b0C were 42.50% and 10.16%, respectively. After heating at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 5 hr, the release rate of the 0, 2, 4, 6 layers assembled microcapsules were 100%, 48.84%, 28.38%, 19.3%, severally. Microcapsules also had good pH sensitivity in the range of 4 to 10. Antimicrobial function studies showed that the microcapsules are more effective than thyme oil for three tested microorganisms. When the temperature rose from 37\u00a0\u00b0C to 121\u00a0\u00b0C, the antibacterial zone of thyme oil gradually decreased from 18.5 \u00b1 0.6 mm to 12.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.6 mm, although inhibition rate of microcapsules increased from 87.97% to 99.75%. The antibacterial effect of thyme oil declined with the increase of pH, in terms of microcapsules, the efficiency was better under acidic or alkaline conditions. The thyme oil microcapsules can suppress the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in milk and prolong its shelf life. It was determined that this microcapsule could be a potential alternative as a natural antimicrobial agent in food and pharmaceutical industries. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This work provided release performance and mechanism of layer-by-layer (LBL) thyme oil microcapsule under different conditions, and further studies showed its antibacterial ability to explore how herb essential oils can be potentially applied in food packaging and antibacterial areas."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0656-8150"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Rongrong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Die", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Wu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural Univ., 430070, Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiaping", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "0900202904", "Agency": "Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alginates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alginates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "09", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "02", "Day": "09"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "03", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31070787", "10.1111/1750-3841.14610"]}}]}
