The free radicals and zebrafish embryos were used to compare the antioxidant activities of HPE and PRF in vitro and in vivo. Then, the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model was established in rats. Neurological deficit score, infarction rate, morphology and apoptosis of neurons were examined to investigate the protective effects of PRF on CIRI. The mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the activities of downstream antioxidant enzymes in ischemia tissues were determined to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Also, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in zebrafish embryos were detected after incubation with PRF for a short time (2\u00a0h) to investigate whether PRF could directly eliminate free radicals. Finally, chemical composition of PRF were analyzed to investigate the material basis for antioxidant activity and anti-CIRI effect.", "Compared with HPE, PRF showed stronger antioxidant activities. PRF exhibited obvious protective effects including ameliorating neurological deficit, lowering infarction rate, and improving the cellular morphology in hippocampus CA1 and cortex after tMCAO. TUNEL staining suggested PRF dose-dependently improved the apoptosis of the neurons in ischemic cortex. RT-qPCR and Western Blot results suggested that PRF regulated oxidative stress (OS) via activating the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Also, PRF could directly scavenge excessive ROS in zebrafish embryos after a short-time PRF incubation. The anti-CIRI effect might be primarily attributed to the abundant polyphenols in PRF, including flavonoids, polymethoxylated flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, and phenolic acids.", "T. quinquecostatus contains abundant polyphenols and exhibited a good protective effect against CIRI via dual antioxidant mechanisms, providing a reference for further research and application for this plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
