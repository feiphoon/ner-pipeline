The mechanism of action of Hypericum perforatum comprehends a neurotransmitter inhibitory profile, and potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects suggesting a role for pain management. In this case report, we describe a 53-year-old Hispanic female patient who came to our orofacial pain clinical service presenting with a history of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The patient was not able to get an appointment soon enough and decided to take an over the counter homeopathic preparation of Hypericum perforatum since she found on the internet that it was effective for nerve pain. The patient responded dramatically to the Hypericum perforatum preparation. The use of this homeopathic preparation relieved completely the TN pain. The management of TN is often a challenge. Hypericum perforatum may be a promising therapeutic option for TN that deserves to be explored further to solidly support its use in the clinical setting."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
