Urb. (Apiaceae) is an important medicinal plant, and it has been using to prepare herbal medicines. The compounds responsible for the biological activity of C. asiatica are triterpenoids such as asiaticoside. Asiaticoside is also important as a marker for standardization of C. asiatica. Due to the low content, there is a need to enhance the production of asiaticoside of C. asiatica. The biotechnological approach is one of the methods that can be used to enhance its production.", "This study was designed to enhance the production of asiaticoside from C. asiatica using A. rhizogenes and elicitation experiments.", "Callus cultures were initiated using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1.0 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurin (BAP). All media were supplemented with 4% (w/w) sucrose and solidified with 0.9% agar. Elicitations were done using pectin, methyl jasmonate, and Cu(2+) ions. Transformed hairy root cultures were performed using A. rhizogenes.", "Callus culture of C. asiatica was successfully initiated. Enhancement of the production of asiaticoside in the callus culture by elicitors pectin was up to 31%; methyl jasmonate (50 \u03bcM) in cell suspension cultures at day 14 was up to 171% compared to explant and 494% compared to control callus; copper ion (25 \u03bcM) at day 21 was up to 144% compared to explant, and 676% compared to control cell suspension cultures. While enhancement by genetic transformation using A. rhizogenes was 166-172% compare to untransformed roots", "Elicitation and genetically transformed hairy root cultures of C. asiatica produced asiaticoside up to 172% higher than untreated callus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Biology Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Ruslan", "ForeName": "Komar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Selfitri", "ForeName": "Anggrahaeni Dewi", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bulan", "ForeName": "Shella A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rukayadi", "ForeName": "Yaya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elfahmi"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Angiology. 2001 Oct;52 Suppl 2:S55-9", "ArticleIdList": ["11666125"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Physiol. 2004 Aug;45(8):976-84", "ArticleIdList": ["15356323"]}, {"Citation": "Life Sci. 2004 Mar 19;74(18):2237-49", "ArticleIdList": ["14987949"]}, {"Citation": "J Nat Prod. 2006 Jan;69(1):55-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16441068"]}, {"Citation": "Curr Opin Plant Biol. 2006 Jun;9(3):341-6", "ArticleIdList": ["16616871"]}, {"Citation": "Angiology. 2001 Oct;52 Suppl 2:S49-54", "ArticleIdList": ["11666124"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Oct;87(19):7713-6", "ArticleIdList": ["11607107"]}, {"Citation": "Biomed Chromatogr. 2006 Feb;20(2):151-3", "ArticleIdList": ["16206136"]}, {"Citation": "Life Sci. 2004 Dec 17;76(5):585-97", "ArticleIdList": ["15556170"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "08", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "10", "Day": "05"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "05", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22701283", "10.4103/0973-1296.96552", "PM-8-111", "PMC3371431"]}}]}
