This systematic review study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of <i>C. asiatica</i> for reducing facial wrinkles. PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thai Library Integrated System, and Thai university database/journals were searched until May 2019. Five double-blinded randomised controlled trials, including 172 Asian females, were included. Endpoints were wrinkling measured by visual score, image analysis, and participant satisfaction. Two placebo-controlled studies applied gel/creams containing <i>C</i>. <i>asiatica</i> or asiaticoside for 12 w to periorbital skin. Two studies applied tretinoin or <i>Pueraria mirifica</i> contralaterally and by network meta-analysis <i>C</i>. <i>asiatica</i> appeared more effective than <i>P. mirifica</i> but possibly less than tretinoin. Asiaticoside applied as a lipstick for 8 w reduced lip wrinkling. Skin hydration was markedly raised by <i>C. asiatica</i> but not tretinoin. One study reported 10 adverse events for <i>C. asiatica</i> and 35 for tretinoin. Cochrane risk of bias was generally low, reporting was weak, and lack of <i>C. asiatica</i> standardization prevents general application. From the reported data, it is possible to conclude that <i>C. asiatica</i> improved lip and periocular wrinkles, and may replace retinoids if its long-term safety is established and <i>C. asiatica</i> is standardized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Naresuan University,
