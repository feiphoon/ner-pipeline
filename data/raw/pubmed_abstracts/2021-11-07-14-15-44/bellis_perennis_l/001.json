(Asteraceae) (common daisy) is a herbaceous perennial plant known as a traditional wound herb; it has been used for the treatment of bruises, broken bones, and wounds. Bellis perennis has also been used in the treatment of headache, common cold, stomachache, eye diseases, eczema, skin boils, gastritis, diarrhea, bleeding, rheumatism, inflammation, and infections of the upper respiratory tract in traditional medicine.", "Antitumor activities of different fractions of B. perennis flowers at different concentrations were evaluated and through bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation procedures a saponin derivative (1) was isolated from the active fraction obtained from the n-butanol extract of flowers of the title plant by column chromatography.", "Antitumor activities of different fractions of B. perennis flowers at different concentrations were evaluated using Potato Disc Tumor Induction Bioassay.
