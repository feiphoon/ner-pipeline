We have previously shown that two weeks of treatment with a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) improves cognition and activates the endogenous antioxidant response pathway without altering amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque burden.", "Here, we assess the effect of long-term treatment of CAW in the 5xFAD mouse model of A\u03b2 accumulation.", "Four-month-old 5xFAD mice were treated with CAW in their drinking water (2\u200ag/L) for three months at which point they underwent cognitive testing as well as analysis of A\u03b2 plaque levels and antioxidant and synaptic gene expression. In order to confirm the involvement of the antioxidant regulatory transcription factor NRF2 on the effects of CAW on synaptic plasticity, neurons isolated from 5xFAD mice were also treated with CAW and the targeted inhibitor ML385.", "Three months of treatment with CAW improved spatial and contextual memory as well as executive function in 5xFAD mice. This improvement was accompanied by increased antioxidant gene expression and a decrease in A\u03b2 plaque burden relative to untreated 5xFAD animals. In isolated neurons, treatment with ML385 blocked the effects of CAW on dendritic arborization and synaptic gene expression.", "These results suggest that prolonged CAW exposure could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease and that these effects likely involve NRF2 activation. Moreover, these findings suggest that targeting NRF2 itself may be a relevant therapeutic strategy for improving synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Zweig", "ForeName": "Jonathan A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Brandes", "ForeName": "Mikah S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biostatistics & Design Program Core, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Brumbach", "ForeName": "Barbara H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Caruso", "ForeName": "Maya", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "Kirsten M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Parkinson's Disease Research Education and Clinical Care Center (PADRECC), VA Portland Healthcare System, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Quinn", "ForeName": "Joseph F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Soumyanath", "ForeName": "Amala", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "Nora E", "Initials": "NE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Alzheimers Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9814863", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Centella asiatica extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazolidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nfe2l2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spiro Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "VU0468809"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Discrimination Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazolidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Spiro Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33935097", "JAD210271", "10.3233/JAD-210271"]}}]}
