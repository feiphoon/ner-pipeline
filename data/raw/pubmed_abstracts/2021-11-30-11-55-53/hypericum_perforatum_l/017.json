Using xCELLigence, a real-time monitoring system, a dose of 10 \u00b5g/mL was found to be the most efficient concentration for vitality. The IC50 values and doubling time were calculated. The results showed that H. perforatum L. was able to accelerate osteogenic differentiation in DP-MSCs, but calcium granulation was impaired in BM-MSCs. H. perforatum L.-induced migration increased when compared to the TNF-\u03b1-induced migration in a Transwell migration assay, and the IL-6 cytokine levels between cells also differed. It can be suggested that tissue memory is an important factor in MSCs, and that they differ in their response to external factors. In conclusion, H. perforatum L. can be considered an excellent osteoinductive agent for DP-MSCs but should not be used for BM-MSCs. Tissue-specific osteoinductive agents should be discussed in future studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 S.
