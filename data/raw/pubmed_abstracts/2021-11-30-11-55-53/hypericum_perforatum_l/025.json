Five acids were evaluated for the digestion of the Polish Certified Reference Material Tea Leaves (INCT-TL-1), while three were taken forward to use for the different St John's wort formulations (i.e. herb, capsule and tablet). A simple protocol using 5 ml HNO<sub>3</sub> was sufficient in most cases; however, variability was observed for elements often bound in silicates (e.g. Al, Fe and Zn). An external weighted calibration was also found to be preferential over unweighted, and the use of standard addition affected some concentration values up to 20%.", "Therefore, this paper presents the development and optimized method parameters to be used with ICP-OES that will allow the analysis of 11 key elements present in St John's wort herb and preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Royal Pharmaceutical Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Owen", "ForeName": "Jade D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Sara J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Guirguis", "ForeName": "Amira", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Kellett", "ForeName": "Kathryn", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8365-5894"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Stair", "ForeName": "Jacqueline L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nebulizers and Vaporizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "01"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "04", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28560741", "10.1111/jphp.12742"]}}]}
