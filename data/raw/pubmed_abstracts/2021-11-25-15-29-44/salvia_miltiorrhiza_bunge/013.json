(SM) on the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell line DU-145, in vitro and in vivo.", "Prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) and normal prostate cell line (RWPE-1) were treated with SM at different concentrations (3.125, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/mL) to investigate the antiproliferative effects. DNA laddering analysis was performed to investigate the apoptosis of DU-145 cells. Molecular mechanism was investigated by Western blot analysis of p53, Bcl-2, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and androgen receptor (AR). Six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were randomly divided into normal control group (n=101) and treated group (n=101) which administered 500 mg/kg SM for 2 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured.", "Treatment with SM resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell number of DU-145 cells in comparison with RWPE-1. DNA laddering analysis indicated the apoptosis of DU-145 cells. Treatment with SM increased the expression of p53 and reduced the expression of Bcl-2 proteins. The levels of PSA were considerably reduced in SM-treated group compared to the controls, and a decrease in AR expression was observed when cells were treated with SM in the same pattern as a reduction in PSA. In the tumour xenograft study, SM given once a day for 2 weeks significantly inhibited tumour growth.", "SM might contribute to the anticancer actions such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Catholic Integrative Medicine Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Woong Jin", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jin Bong", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kang Sup", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "U Syn", "Initials": "US"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Sung Hoo", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ji Youl", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Tae-Kon", "Initials": "TK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Korea Bio-Medical Science Institute, Seoul, 06106, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Sung Yeoun", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730030, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Ping", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. ksw1227@catholic.ac.kr."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Catholic Integrative Medicine Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. ksw1227@catholic.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sae Woong", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101181180", "ISSNLinking": "1672-0415"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "05", "Day": "03"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28337641", "10.1007/s11655-017-2801-5", "10.1007/s11655-017-2801-5"]}}]}
