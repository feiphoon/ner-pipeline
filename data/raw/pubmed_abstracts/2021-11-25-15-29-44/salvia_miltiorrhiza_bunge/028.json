Previous reports show that the expression of (E-type prostaglandin 2) EP2 and (E-type prostaglandin 4) EP4 are elevated in HCC and further demonstrate that Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces HA22T cell proliferation and metastasis through EP2 and EP4 receptor. Danshen (root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) is a very important and popular traditional Chinese herbal medicine which is widely and successfully used against breast cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. In this study, we used Cryptotansinone (Dsh-003) (MW 269.14) from Danshen to investigate their effect and corresponding mechanism of action in PGE2-treated HA22T cells. Dsh-003 inhibited HA22T cell viability and further induced cell apoptosis in PGE2-treated HA22T cells. Furthermore, Dsh-003 inhibited EP2, EP4, and their downstream effector such as p-PI3K and p-Akt expression in HA22T hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We also observed that Dsh-003 blocked PGE2-induced cell migration by down-regulating PGE2-induced \u03b2-catenin expression and by up-regulating E-cadherin and GSK3-\u03b2 expression. All these findings suggest that Dsh-003 inhibit human HCC cell lines and could potentially be used as a novel drug for HCC treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."},
