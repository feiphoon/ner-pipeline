Document data showed that tanshinones, a class of lipophilic abietane diterpenes rich in this herb, possess multiple biological effects in vitro and in vivo models. Among which, 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I (DHT) has received much attention in recent years. In this systematical review, we carefully selected, analyzed, and summarized high-quality publications related to pharmacological effects and the underlying mechanisms of DHT. DHT has anti-cancer, cardiovascular protective, anti-inflammation, anti-Alzheimer's disease, and other effects. Furthermore, several molecules such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1), human antigen R (HuR), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), etc. have been identified as the potential targets for DHT. The diverse pharmacological activities of DHT provide scientific evidence for the local and traditional uses of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. We concluded that DHT might serve as a lead compound for drug discovery in related diseases while further in-depth investigations are still needed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
