The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of herb pair Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge-Radix Puerariae (DG) on diabetic vascular injury induced by streptozotocin. The protective effect of DG was determined by oral administration of DG (50 and 200\u202fmg/kg) in rats and on high glucose (HG)-induced endothelial injury. DG showed no effect on body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) but decreased the serum levels of insulin, nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (s-ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (s-VCAM-1), and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels. The pathological alterations of aorta was improved by DG. Furthermore, the increased expression of ICAM-1,VCAM-1, NOX2, and NOX4 in aorta were inhibited by DG. HG-induced endothelial ROS formation, ICAM-1,VCAM-1, NOX4 expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion were dramatically suppressed by DG as well. In addition, both GKT137831, a NOX4 inhibitor, and PDTC, a NF-\u03baB inhibitor, could significantly inhibited HG-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion. These results suggested that DG improved diabetic vascular injury possibly by reducing oxidative stress, which provides scientific evidence for the application of DG for diabetic vascular therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
