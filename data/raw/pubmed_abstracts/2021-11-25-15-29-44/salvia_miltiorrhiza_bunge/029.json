The absolute configurations of chiral centers were determined by comparison with reported coupling constants, optical rotation values, and CD techniques. Anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated using nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition assays, and by determining the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Two new caffeic acid derivatives, 8-epiblechnic acid 9-methyl ester (4) and 8-epiblechnic acid 9'-methyl ester (5), and eight known derivatives, caffeic acid methyl ester (1), shimobashiric acid B (2), rosmarinic acid methyl ester (3), salvianolic acid C (6), methyl salvianolate C (7), lithospermic acid monomethyl ester (8), lithospermic acid dimethyl ester (9), and dimethyl lithospermate B (10), were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of S. miltiorrhiza. All caffeic acid derivatives were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on NO production. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited NO production with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.4 and 0.6\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. These compounds also strongly inhibited the production of iNOS and COX-2. In addition, compound 3 induced the expression HO-1 in a concentration-dependent manner at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, 41566, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Hyun Gyu", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Tran", "ForeName": "Phuong Thao", "Initials": "PT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Natural Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 24341, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jeong-Hyung", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Drug Research and Development Center, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan, 38430, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Min", "ForeName": "Byung Sun", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, 41566, Republic of Korea. jkim6923@knu.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jeong Ah", "Initials": "JA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NRF-2015M3A9A5031271", "Agency": "Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Arch Pharm Res. 2019 Apr;42(4):378", "PMID": "30456742"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "04", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "03"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29124660", "10.1007/s12272-017-0983-1", "10.1007/s12272-017-0983-1"]}}]}
