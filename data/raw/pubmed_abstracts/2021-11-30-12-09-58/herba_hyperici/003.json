Black lipid membrane experiments were performed to investigate the effect of the ethanolic Hyp extract on the electrical properties (capacitance and conductance) of artificial lipid bilayers. Hyp extract (1-10 microg mL(-1)) induced a concentration-dependent increase of both specific transmembrane capacitance and conductance in phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. The effect on conductance was enhanced when the Hyp extract (3 microg mL(-1)) was present on both sides of the membrane (Gm=77.89 +/- 8.81 nS cm(-2), n=5) compared with single-sided application (Gm=36.48 +/- 2.41 nS cm(-2), n=5). In bilayers containing PC and phosphatidylserine (PS), PC:PS, the Hyp extract effect was greater than on pure PC bilayers, although the surface charge was not the determining factor of this enhanced activity. Adding cholesterol to the PC:PS mixture reverted the conductance increase induced by the Hyp extract in a dose-dependent manner. The specific pattern of the Hyp extract interaction with lipid bilayers has possible consequences concerning its absorption and bioavailability, as well as its pharmacodynamic effects on neuronal excitability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Physiology and Biophysics, University of Bucharest, Faculty of Biology, Splaiul Independentei 91-95, Bucharest R-050095, Romania."}], "LastName": "Neagoe", "ForeName": "Ioana", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Macri", "ForeName": "Beatrice M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Flonta", "ForeName": "Maria Luisa", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylserines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Capacitance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylcholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylserines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15482643", "10.1211/0022357044292"]}}]}
