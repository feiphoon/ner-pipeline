It is also known to have shown antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects against various cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Hypericum perforatum L on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced rat oral squamous cell carcinoma model.", "The in vitro antioxidant properties of Hypericum perforatum L was determined and an extract was prepared. Thirty Wistar male rats were divided randomly into 4 groups (Control group, DMBA group, HP\u202f+\u202fDMBA group, HP group). The antioxidant defense mechanisms in tissue and blood samples were evaluated biochemically and immunohistochemically, the carcinomatous changes in connective tissue were investigated immunohistochemically and epithelial changes in the tissue samples were evaluated histopathologically.", "The extract revealed inhibitory effects on some antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase). Immunohistochemical evaluations revealed no invasive changes in the connective tissue. Hypericum perforatum L demonstrated chemopreventive effects although it did not prevent carcinomatous changes altogether.", "Hypericum perforatum L is a promising chemopreventive agent and further studies are needed in order to evaluate the full potential of this plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
