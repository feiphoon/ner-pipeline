    "abstract": "Submucosal hematoma (SH) is one of the rare causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. As a rare and critical disease in clinical practice, it should be paid more attention to by clinicians to avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Most of the esophageal submucosal hematomas have clear causes, including retrosternal pain, dysphagia, \nThe patient was a 60-year-old male with a history of gastritis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and coronary stent implantation. The patient developed chest tiredness and heartburn after taking 10 capsules of a homemade mixture of hirudin and notoginseng powder in the previous 2 d. He did not have hematemesis or black stool. Gastroscopy and chest computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of SH, which ranged from the pharynx to the lower esophagus and was 35-40 cm in length. After the diagnosis was confirmed, we performed active conservative treatment on the patient, and the patient recovered well and remained asymptomatic during the 26-mo follow-up.\nSH is rare, and cases with atypical clinical symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Ignorance of this disease can lead to serious clinical consequences. Conservative therapy is effective and the prognosis is good.",
