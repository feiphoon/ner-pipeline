    "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to explore the structure characteristics, immune regulation, and anti-cancer abilities of polysaccharides in radix ginseng Rubra (RGR). For this purpose, RGR polysaccharides (RGRP) were purified through DEAE and S-300 chromatography. Monosaccharide composition, methylation, and GC-MS analyses, as well as field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), Fourier-transformed infrared resonance (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, were used to establish the structure of RGRP-1b. Our results revealed that RGRP-1a and RGRP-1b possess different molecular weights (21.3\u202fkDa and 10.2\u202fkDa, respectively). RGRP-1a was found to be composed of glucose, while RGRP-1b was composed of glucose, galactose, and arabinose. The main chain structure of RGRP-1b was composed of 1,4-\u03b1-Glcp, with a 1,4,6-\u03b1-Glcp branch unit. Its side chains were branched at the O-4 position of 1,4,6-\u03b1-Glcp, namely 1)-\u03b2-Galp-(4\u202f\u2192\u202f1)-\u03b1-Araf-(5\u202f\u2192\u202f\u03b1-Araf and 1)-\u03b2-Galp-(6\u202f\u2192\u202f\u03b1-Glcp. The changes in the nitric oxide (NO) levels and cytotoxicity revealed that macrophages probably get activated by RGRP-1b. The expressions of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 were found to be upregulated after treatment with RGRP-1b. RGRP-1b thus possesses the potential to arrest the growth of Huh7 through immunoregulation. Our cumulative findings indicate that RGRP-1b obtained from radix ginseng Rubra can function as a strong immune modulator.",
