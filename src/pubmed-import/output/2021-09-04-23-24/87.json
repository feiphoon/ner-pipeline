    "abstract": "Melanosis in shrimp usually leads to reduction in its shelf life and quality, which causes a significant loss in economic value of shrimp products. This study reports potential applications of nine ethanolic extracts of by-products, i.e., peel and/or seed from three Vietnamese avocado varieties as effective inhibitors of melanosis in whiteleg shrimp. Six out of nine shrimp samples treated with the prepared extracts (0.025%, w/v) reduced melanosis and lipid oxidation more significantly as compared to those treated with sodium metabisulfite (SMS, 1.25%, w/v) and control groups (treated with water) during 8-day storage at 4\u00b0C (",
