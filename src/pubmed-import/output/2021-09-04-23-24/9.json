    "abstract": "Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with thrombosis. A 48-year-old female with PV presented with right eye pain following a low-impact head trauma. She consumed aspirin for analgesia and took preparations of Chinese herbs. CT head revealed right-sided subdural hematoma. She had reduced Von Willebrand activity to 26%.\u00a0Direct angiographic imaging showed an aneurysm arising from a right middle cerebral atery (MCA) branch. The patient was given 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) prior to the craniotomy. Intra-operative examination revealed that the aneurysm-like structure was a small grape-like structure of the fibrinous part of the subdural membrane that had formed from the subdural hematoma. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is an important risk factor for bleeding in PV. DDAVP may be useful to increase levels of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and decrease the risk of bleeding perioperatively. Exogenous substances such as ginseng should be investigated as possible contributors to bleeding tendency and discontinued.",
