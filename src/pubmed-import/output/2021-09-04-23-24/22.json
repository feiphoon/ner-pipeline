    "abstract": "Since the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling plays an important role in tumor-immune microenvironments, in the present study, the role of STAT3/PD-L1 signaling in the apoptotic mechanism of an active ginseng saponin metabolite compound K (CK) was investigated in human prostate cancer cells. Here, CK exerted significant cytotoxicity without hurting RWPE1 normal prostate epithelial cells, increased sub-G1 and cleavage of Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and attenuated the expression of pro-PARP and Pro-cysteine aspartyl-specific protease3 (pro-caspase-3) in LANCap, PC-3 and DU145 cells. Further, CK attenuated the expression of p-STAT3 and PD-L1 in DU145 cells along with disrupted the binding of STAT3 to PD-L1. Furthermore, CK effectively abrogated the expression of p-STAT3 and PD-L1 in interferon-gamma (INF-\u03b3)-stimulated DU145cells. Additionally, CK suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) as immune escape-related genes in DU145 cells. Likewise, as STAT3 targets genes, the expression of CyclinD1, c-Myc and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) was attenuated in CK-treated DU145 cells. Notably, CK upregulated the expression of microRNA193a-5p (miR193a-5p) in DU145 cells. Consistently, miR193a-5p mimic suppressed p-STAT3, PD-L1 and pro-PARP, while miR193a-5p inhibitor reversed the ability of CK to attenuate the expression of p-STAT3, PD-L1 and pro-PARP in DU145 cells. Taken together, these findings support evidence that CK induces apoptosis via the activation of miR193a-5p and inhibition of PD-L1 and STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer cells.",
